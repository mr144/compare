The last time I used Windows mobile I was quite disappointed due to the functionality being sluggish. This time however, I was totally surprised. Not only the phone was fast, but also the features were quite innovative. For a person who comes from iPhone background, I was impressed by seeing the user interface. If I want to put it in a nutshell, the windows phone is just different from other smart phones. and certainly for the price (170$ tax and shipping included thanks to Amazon market place :) ), it was a no-brainer.
