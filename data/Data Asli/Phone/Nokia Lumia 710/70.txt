I got this phone 1 month ago. Pros: Great size. It sure feels different than all the other phones I have ever had. All my friends said that it gives a higher class and comfortable feeling when held in hand.Very fast when opening applications and doing day to day work. Seriously, you do not need the a billion apps on Applestore. Most apps a person use is probably 20 apps. This phone does everything, Word, PDF, Email, SMS, GPS, FacebookWhy load yourself with other applications that makes your phone so complicated? Less is More. Nokia clearly demonstrated this with this phone.I switched from using an Android phone (HTC Sensation), and iPhone, I realized that this is the phone I will use from day to day. Make my business calls, emails and etc, instead of having a phone loaded with apps that just slows the phone down.EXTREMELY LONG BATTERY LIFE!! I WENT TWO DAYS (48 hours) without charging my phone (mobile data turned on in total of 20 - 30 min, wifi off most of the time, other than 10 - 15 min when checking emails. average talk time.. not chatting)Average charging cycle: 1.5 days / chargeCons: Camera is not so great.
