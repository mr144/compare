I bought Nokia Lumia as a Nokia mobile phone fan. I was a Symbian user and now I tried Windows Phone. The phone is a great choise for middle cost cellphones. The cellphone is fast and has good memory.Some considerations about Windows Phone 7.5Good things:- Too fast- Excelent integrations (FB, Twitter, Windows Live, Google, etc.)- Nokia Maps- Good internet browser (Internet Explorer)-BAD:- Low quantity apps in marketplace- Low battery power (max 2 days)- Impossible to create a new contact on phone. You must include on Windows Live or others social networks.- No support to 4G network-
