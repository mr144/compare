The phone is fine...until it suddenly died 5 month after purchase. Cause of death is uncertain.&#34;Wireless Everything&#34; might know...Phone was from France (god knows why) and comes with french instructions and European charger. This is also the reason why the Nokia warranty is not valid.Terrible customer service from the beginning.Lesson learned...Behind a good price there is always a very good reason.
