For a phone that costs less than $200 including shipping, it is excellent! I got the phone only today, and I may change my opinion later if need be, but if it functions normally, I am most likely to be very happy with the purchase. So here are the reasons why I love the phone already:-- For the price, the phone looks great &#8212; almost as good as any other phone out there! it is great to hold and show off. I was expecting it to look cheap, but it does not. I am glad I got it in black.-- The user interface design is impressive. Microsoft has clearly put a lot of thought into what the interface should look like, and the result is really cool.-- The touch screen is very responsive &#8212; there are no lag or crashes. Apps works great.-- And, like I said, it cost me less than $200 with shipping!There are three minor drawbacks too:-- The phone takes some getting used too, especially if you are used to an iPhone. The user interface &#8211; as cool as it is &#8211; is not always intuitive. You will be hunting for menus, options, and buttons that you can easily find on the iPhone. But once you get used to it, it is not a big deal.-- If you love apps, this phone supports a very limited number of them. Given that it hosts Windows 7.5, which is now outdated, there's little hope that it will get a whole lot of apps in the future. But it serves the purposes I bought it for: email, facebook, youtube, and web surfing. So it works for me.-- The camera, although 5 mpx, is not the best in the world. The pictures are not super clear as they are on an iPhone, but then the iPhone costs $650. Having said that, it is not terrible either. It works well enough for the price.
