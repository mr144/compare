I have had the phone for a little over a month now and I love everything about it. I have been a fan of the Windows Phone OS now for about a year (I owned a Samsung Focus before) and this phone optimizes it is potential. The True-Black screen is easily visible in the sun (almost as much as an AMOLED) and has great color (much better than the iPhone 4 or 4S). The Windows Phone OS is right on par with iOS (and will probably surpass it with the WP8 release) and far surpasses the juvenile Android OS. For those wondering, I have had an iOS device and several Android devices, even the Nexus S on ICS. As for the PHONE part of this device, it has more clear voice calls and better reception than any phone I have had, though that is not surprising with Nokia. The only reason that I give the camera and battery a 9 rather than 10 is because the camera is only 5MP (what you would expect from a mid-range phone) and the battery is only 1300 mAh, which is still plenty to get me through a full day with pretty heavy usage. Speaking as one that likes to change phones as often as I change my clothes (not really, but almost) I can easily say that this is my favorite phone and the one that I have the most fun using, which is always a bonus in a smart device.
