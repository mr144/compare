I simply love Windows 7. What an aesthetic sense Nokia and Microsoft engineers have... I just get the feel good feeling as soon as I browse through my phone. Android was so Juvenile. I have used LG Optimus android phone and now I am loving Lumia.Touch screen is just amazing.Cons.I would say this do not have sony walkman kind of music. But still it is great, no complains.Battery life sucks, yes big time.Every file needs to be transferred through Skydrive or Zune, cant just drag and drop. Limited 8GB space.I would highly recommend this product and for just 183$ I would give it a 4.2 STAR out of 5.
