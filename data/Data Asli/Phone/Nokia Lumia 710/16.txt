As far the usability goes, I have very good things to say.1) Graphics are pretty good and easy to understand. But the icons (for send message etc) are not at all intuitive.2) Screen quality is pretty good3) Battery is awesome (when WIFI is always off)4) Network reception is also pretty goodThe bad things ...1) Worst of all, when WIFI is turned on and there is not wireless network, the phone gets discharged in about 3 to 4 hours.2) lacks the appbase android or IOS has.3) If you like either of Android or IOS, i think you better off sticking with them.  This is a new interface based on some good ideas, but very poorly designed. Needs to be improved a lot.
