Wanted to stick with Nokia and it was time to upgrade phone from my e52 purchased in europe a few years back.  I was a little concerned when the phone came only with Chinese manual and on start up all menu items were in Chinese.  After hitting a few buttons with Chinese characters on them, I was able to turn the language settings to English and never looked back.  Downloaded Zune and the phone went through about twenty minutes of updates after which everything worked brilliantly.  Love the Windows tiles and is just so easy to use, everything makes sense.  Use the radio, and takes good pictures. Overall, I could not be happier with both the unlocked phone and t-mobile pay as you go service.  For me, this phone has all the features I would ever use and recommend it.
