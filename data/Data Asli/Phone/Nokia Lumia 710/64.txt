I bought this phone a couple weeks ago and I love it. It has the exact same features as the lumia 800 and it cost 200 dollars less so... The only difference is the design and I do not care about the looks. If get upgraded to win8 it is going to be the perfect phone. But...... if you use the videocall feature you can not do it with this phone because it does not have a frontal camera. I have never used it so I am ok with it.Windows phone 7 is great. Super fast, perfct integration with social networks, great gaming experiencia thanks to xbox live. With tango upgrade the internet sharing feature will be enabled. I love skydrive integration.Perfect phone and a great price.
