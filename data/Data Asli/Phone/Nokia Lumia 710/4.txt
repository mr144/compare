Sorry I bought this phone. i bought it because phones in Colombia are very expensive, this seem to be a great deal. The voice mail never worked, the battery started very early to work just for a few hours, after 5 months the battery is useless, It will just not start again, I have lost lots of sales and contacts and work due to this phone. Not a good phone!  The nokia drive does not work in Colombia, the maps are absolutely past. I can not buy the battery here in Colombia.Has a good processor and it is relatively resistant to impacts.
