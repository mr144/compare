Stay away from this phone.You will have a bluetooth that you can not use (even to share files with ANOTHER Lumia 710, pathetic). You have to use zune for file management. It will not work as a flashdrive.It does have a good hardware gear, sure... but I would not waste it with a windows installed.Go to android.
