My Wife loved her old flip phone, but it finally died. I talked her into this phone as it works with her prepaid account on T-Mobile, and she can use Wi-Fi for data, She really likes it, it is easy to use and just works. She tried an android phone a while back and did not like it. Nokia generally makes good phones.Note that it takes the newer micro SIM chip. You may need to buy one like we did. Activation was easy, however, a 5 minute call to T-Mobile support and we were done.The phone also has 8 GB of memory and there is no slot to add more. This is not a problem for her, she has not even used half the memory with several apps/games, some pictures, and some music.
