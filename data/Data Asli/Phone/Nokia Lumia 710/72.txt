The phone is awesome, and the OS is great... watch out iOS!! This phone is lot better than iphone 3gs. However, this phone does not seem to be unlocked. It came with a Tmobile SIM card that I do not know how to activate because it did not include the activation card.Other than that, I found this phone relatively cheap, and very good, specially considering the software capabilities.
