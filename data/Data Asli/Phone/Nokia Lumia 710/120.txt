I ordered this phone because of the reasonable price and the wonderful reviews that it has received by others on Amazon and on the T-mobile web site. The phone arrived as promised in excellent condition. I was a little up set at first because you can not put a SD memory card in BUT the phone's storage is enough to hold all of my music and pictures with no problem. I did have to get my SIM card cut because this phone takes a micro SIM card and my previous phone had a Macro SIM card. All in all, this is a excellent phone, I LOVE IT and would recommend it to anyone.
