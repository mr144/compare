The Nokia phones are dinosaurs that will be left behind by Apple and Android. The only thing they might have had going for them would have been customer service, but they have left the Lumia owners high and dry. There will be no more Apps or development, and there was not much for them to begin with. Avoid their phones and them at all costs. When contacted, they are of no help. After spending a good amount on a new 710, they reward loyal customers, like I was, by phishing for their information, promising Amazon gift certificates, then willfully reneging on them! Seems to be a company barreling toward the technological dungheap!
