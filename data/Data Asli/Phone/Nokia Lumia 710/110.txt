first the battery did not hold charge. second screen had small ding. the battery was fully charged. turned off phone. one week later when turned on battery was dead. the phone comes with screen cover. i noticed a small ding in cover which i thought was in the cover only which is soft clear material. however the ding was in glass. amazon allowed for the return without problem but because of price (under $200) replacement was not available so had to accept refund. i must say the phone was from T Moble and said &#34;new&#34; on box. nokia was super great when called about battery and offered to replace but i had to pay shipping to them. i never used sim card so cannot comment on that function but did use wireless(WiFi) which worked fine. the screen was quite small and typing on screen proved difficult for me.
