I will keep it simple. All I needed was a phone to replace a flip phone that I had that was slow on web browsing.I bought this phone and it has a nice resolution lcd, but it is the little things that make it not worth keeping.First of all my cheaper flip phone could set any ringtone I wanted from any sound file. This device will not do it unless you manually cut a ringtone in pc zune software. Who has time for that if you have a lot of music you like?The battery life is terrible. I had to turn off all services, because when purchased brand new the charge would only last a day. I can understand that because it is a smart phone, but when I do not use it that much it is ridiculous.It uses data even when all services are turned off. I tell you that I looked everywhere and at every menu option to try and turn of the data flow so I could use my internet when I really need it. it is impossible. This device will run data even when you are not doing anything, and you can not turn it off. I would say that it probably runs at least 40mb of data just on stand by. What the hell is that???The on screen key pad for txt is annoying. You would think that practice makes perfect, but this thing has a tendency to input the wrong letter, either that or you need fingertips the size of pencils to get this working effectively. I have an ipod that does better.The camera sucks. Low light, bright light. Good luck with that mess. You can adjust the lighting after the fact, but why bother.Downloading apps is a pain in the ass. Why does it need an outlook account for anything?  You could not even transfer contacts when it initially came out.You can not really customize the tiles. There are themes but they are all solid colors and only a handful.Basically if you just want a phone that dials and gets calls, that's all it is good for. My flip phone never used data for no reason, hence entirely more useful when it has data it has not blown through.
