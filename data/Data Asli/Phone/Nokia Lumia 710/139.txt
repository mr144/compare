Im so enraged at this! So much insufficent information, like how it freaking needsa micro sim card, and how it cant support micro SD! Even so after I am using it more and more I am enjoying it, thought this info stated earlier NEEDS TO BE IN THERE! I have a whole bunch of music I bought but as mp3s so there's no easy way to listen to it on there. But this is a great phone.
