Got this for my mother, but I fell in love with it. Despite being a single core, it is 4G and super fast! A truly underrated phone, but it is amazing. The camera, despite being only 5MP, is extremely quick. I ended up ordering the same one for myself and cannot wait until it arrives! It is quick and it works on the T-Mobile USA network...
