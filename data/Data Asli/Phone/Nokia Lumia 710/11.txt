In order to use this with Outlook, I had to set up windows live or hotmail.  Now Outlook has two sets of contacts and Calendars and two sets of email.  What a nightmare to keep up with.Sometimes email goes through the regular email but sometimes it just decides to send it from the Hotmail connector. No particular rationale for this that I can find.  Also, if I update a contact, I really need to open and update BOTH contacts or else I have two sets of data that do not match.Set up a meeting in your calendar?  Well, do you want to know about it on your phone?  Then you use one calendar but if you want to keep track of who accepted invites, etc. that is a different calendar. So you have to remember to copy paste it into the other calendar.I was told it would sync with Outlook but there is no real connection to the computer like the Palm or Blackberries did. I made CERTAIN that it would sync but apparently the sales people have no idea what sync means.  You have to use the 'cloud'. The more sophisticated the phones become the less true functionality they have.  They have more games and more music but less PHONE use.Also, this phone sometimes loses its mind and will not accept calls.  Sends them to voice mail even if you are right here at the phone waiting for a call.  You sometimes get a quick vibrate but sometimes it just goes to voice mail.  On some bizarre moments it vibrates, shows a missed call and then RINGS with the call.  All unbeknownst to the caller who only knows it has been ringing 5 or 6 times before you answered.To reset the phone when it develops this bizarre behavior you have to save your info with ZUNE so you can reset the phone.  Another software you have to have on the computer that you did not want.  Eventually all your personal info from contacts, email, etc. is so scattered all over the world you have no control over the security whatsoever.I wish Palm had stayed in the game.  My old Palm was a better phone than what I can buy today.
