Everything was perfect with the delivery. The cell phone was brand new and everything was great. I just do not like some features of the phone: I don&#8217;t like how it is very hard to figure out that you have a voice mail &#8211; the little number that show voice mail is very small and hardly visible. I don&#8217;t like how all the calls are listed separately, does not stuck the calls from the same phone number. Overall it is a good phone. I don&#8217;t pay for internet, so I am happy with the Wi-Fi option.
