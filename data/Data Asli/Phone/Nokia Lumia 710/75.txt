If you need a phone to place calls, receive/send emails and want FB, Twitter, etc, updates in a second, then Windows Phone 7.5 is the OS for you. I forgot to mention that MSN Messenger is available also! All of this without downloading or installing anything! All info is on your main screen tiles so you will not need to enter a specific application to see updates but in case you want full apps, you can download them for free! This combined with the superb quality of Nokia phones is a winner!
