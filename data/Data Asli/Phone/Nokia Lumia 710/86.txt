NOkia Lumia 710 is amazing Product , now I am feeling bad of using IPHONE for past years , I like this product very much , it has good touch screen and very good apps and word , excel , one point pad is excellent . The only problem is GPS navigation when I downloaded maps and using them the destinations are pointing correctly ,It takes to the nearest point but not to the actual destinations.Thanks,Bobba
