I have been always buying Nokia and i thought there were the best, but i was very disappointment with nokia Lumia!!! I had to return it, since i could not even install skype on it, i tried all kinds of things and it did not work. it is a good phone if you just want to call or txt. I would say battery life was that long either.Went from Nokia Lumia to Samsung Galaxy and very happy with the purschase, more money, but it definitely worst it!!!
