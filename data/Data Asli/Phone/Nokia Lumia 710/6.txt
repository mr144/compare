I have had this phone for about 10 months and it just stopped working.  I charge it and it hums, but will not turn on.  This seems to be a rather reoccurring experience amongst other owners, it hums and that is it.  The phone was great while it worked, but definitely take out the replacement insurance when you buy it. Nokia will not help.  Keeping it charged and not letting the battery go all the way down seems to be somewhat of a life lengthener, but I would not recommend this phone.  It is not the Nokia I remembered, they are built in Korea which should have told me something.
