I got this phone in July and I have had to replace the phone once, Master Reset phone twice and now I am am having to replace the battery. While T-Mobile was spot on when replacing the phone overnighting it to me, Nokia seems to believe that first waiting 2 business days for someone to call back and confirm because their first level support must be incapable then having to wait 5 to 7 days for shipping is acceptable. NOKIA shame on you. Save your money, it is a crap phone, crap apps and Nokia is not providing timely service.
