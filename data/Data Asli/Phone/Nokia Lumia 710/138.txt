I was partial to Android. Three Android phones later (and also one iPhone later), I decided to take a leap and go with the Lumia 710. I knew it was a low to mid-range Windows 7.5 phone that would not be capable of upgrading to 8, but bought it anyway.I was VERY skeptical, and anticipated sending it back, but I was pleasantly surprised. It does not lag, freeze up, or display any sort of weird stuff that all of my previous Androids displayed. Plus, it synchronizes with everything...I was heavily invested in the Google ecosystem, and it easily synced all my contacts and calendar.The interface is where it really shines. Microsoft has done such a great job (I can not believe I am saying this) creating an ecosystem where everything is very similar in look and feel, using the tile approach. It works very well, and I have really fallen in love with this phone.There are not quite as many apps as Android or iPhone YET, but quite honestly I found everything I needed, and for free. Microsoft Office even comes built-in.Amazing, amazing phone. I can not put it down. I strongly recommend it. I can only imagine how awesome the new Nokia 920 will be.
