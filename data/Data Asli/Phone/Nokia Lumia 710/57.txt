I bought this type of phone for the first time.  I am over fifty so I was a little concern if I am going to see the tiny letters.  I found out I can enlage them. It made me really happy. My phone came with a French instruction which made me to be unable to enjoy this phone right away. Later I printed English instructin from the internet. It helped :)I am using my Nokkia phone for more than three weeks and so far I enjoy it, but I know I could use it i many more ways.
