I bought this phone for my parents and they seem to love it. it is nothing fancy but it is got the basic features that they like in a phone: camera, texting, email, etc. My parents really like the fact that Windows 7.5 is easy to use. The battery life is not very long--that's why I have got to know it down from 5 stars to 3 (battery life is *really important to me*). They usually have to charge the phone every day even though they really do not use it very much.
