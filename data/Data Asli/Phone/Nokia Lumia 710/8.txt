The first give in is it is obviously a windows phone and there's not too many apps for it, and most games your friends play on androids and iphones you will not be able to join in on.That being said, I would not trade it for anything else because of how organized it is!  I love how the People pin lets you link accounts.  I tap my brother's name and it gives me the option to email him, write on his facebook wall, call him, text him, tweet him, etc. all from one page.  Skydrive keeps my church notes, school notes, and backs up any pictures I take in case of accidental deletion.  The calander view is very simple yet detailed and my unlock screen will show my next scheduled item.  I know other phones have apps to do as much, but rather than having a cluster of apps for each thing and scrolling pages to find the right app, Windows has less apps that combine tasks and accomplish the same thing for less space.On a bonus note, a lot of games for this phone work with xbox live and give you achievements.  There's even a Xbox tile that gives you access to your xbox account and messages.If you love being organized and having easier access to apps you need, I did recommend this phone.  If you are a heavy Angry Birds or Words With Friends person....... look somewhere else.
