So many issues with this phone. Lets start with positives: Good looking pocket friendly phone, Windows 7.5 is very user friendly. Now the negatives: 8GB of memory!!!!! No SD card!!! And I have to use Zune to put music on the phone. Does not just come up as a mass storage device. UNACCEPTABLE! The original IPhone in 2007 had 8GB of memory!! Poor battery life but at least its a removable battery. Windows Marketplace has small amount of apps. Coming from Android and IPhone users will be in shock of the lack of apps we use on as daily basis.
