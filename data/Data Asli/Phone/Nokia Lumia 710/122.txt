I purchased this phone on December the 6th, it arrived on December the 11th, it was not opened until January 6th so that it was a birthday gift for this day. After opened it, we discover that was not truly unlocked. The problem is that we can not return so that return term has expired besides the fact that item was obviously opened.If you are consider to buy a unlocked phone through I would think it again.
