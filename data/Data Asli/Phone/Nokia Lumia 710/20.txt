I love the fact that it is a single-core yet it does not slow down.The Windows mobile are a hit-and-miss, but the OS is great for my usage.I hate the fact where the Windows OS limits Nokia's full features. I mean, there are better things in Symbian that should have been in this phone in the first place.The player's UI is dated, like Windows 95 or something with the &#34;High Contrast&#34; option. The way to change songs looks awful comparing to the song switching methods of my Blackberry Torch, plus Torch has a Stop button.Also, with the Torch, if I press the volume keys a bit hard, I can switch songs from there.Ring-tone is 40 seconds? Symbian allowed the full song to be the ring-tone, this needs to be fixed.Windows 7.8 might bring 8-like features, but they are opting for a Ring-tone maker to fulfill the 40 second limit, which is a disappointment, but hopefully they do listen to the users complaining on their UserVoice site. (Highly recommended to post there for anything you want in later versions).Overall, I recommend this phone to simple users.
