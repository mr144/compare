The phone is great , simple to set up and transfer numbers via Bluetooth through Nokia app reinstalled.  Have not had any issues with it yet in 3 months I have owned it and used it. Pretty quick phone probably be a lot faster with 4g but meh not that important. The only complaint I have about this phone is the battery life is not the greatest but bout the same for all smart phones. The battery is only a 1300mah when I think it should have like a 1600-1700 mah.  Still lasts 2 days with moderate use with the 1300mah. Otherwise perfect phone so far.
