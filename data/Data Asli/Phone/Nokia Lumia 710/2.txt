I purchased and received this phone while visiting Orlando April 17 2013. At my return to Venezuela, went to Movilnet, one of the three the companys  that provide cell phone services. Surprise! They told me that the phone was LOOCKED, and the solution to unlock it was obtaining a code via Internet, and of course, with a payment of U.S.$ 34,00. The same answer was received from Telcel and Movistar, the other two companies that provides cell phone services, so I do not have any option that pay the amount, an wait two or three days to receive the equipment unlocked. Can I reccomend the seller?
