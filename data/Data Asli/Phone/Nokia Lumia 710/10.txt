At first, I really liked this phone for the looks. When starting to use it, I found out that the the basics of the phone were easy to use and easy to learn. Everything works well and I would definitely recommend it for those who are not considering to use the applications much. In comparison to other smart phones on the market, this phone definitely needs more work. The applications which other phones (ex. iPhone, Samsung, etc) have are substantially better in quality and usage. Popular applications like gmail chat, kakaotalk, instagram, etc. have do not work well and most times not at all. Games also are very limited, you will not find a good version of angry birds, doodle jump, bejeweled, plants vs. zombies, etc. Since this phone is fairly new on the market, I am hoping that the applications will considerably improve. If you are hoping for a phone with tons of applications, I extremely warn you, this is not your phone. Other than that, I like this phone and its easy usage.
