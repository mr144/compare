This cellphone is really good for this price, I bought it 2 months ago and I am totally satisfied with my purchase.The system is fast and looks nice, specially in red and brightness on MID.  Nokia Drive is really nice, the way to manage your contacts looks well designed. I am also a .NET programmer and learn to program for this phone has been easy. it has a lot of potential and I can highly recommend this phone to everyone. I had an Iphone 4 before and this cellphone is better.Also as a note this cellphone it is totally unlocked (currently working with TELCEL Mexico)
