This is a great phone. From the first time I picked it up I noticed that it was a lot faster than my old Galaxy I. There was no comparison really.  The overall feel and design is also better in my opinion. I went to the T Mobile store and explained how I chucked my old phone at the ground because it was glitching and how their out sourced customer service sucked so bad they actually hooked me up with a free phone cover.(which probably costs all of 99c purchased whole sale) but it was the thought that counts.NICE PHONE!
