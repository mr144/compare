About the cellphone: I like very much lots of new features. For example: the home menu it is soo easy, is very quick, the internet is great, the navigation buttons are simple, ... but I dislike that most of the applications are charged, in my old Nokia device I could download Whatsapp for free;the new way to save your contacts is kind of new for me, 'cause I used to save them on the phone not in my hotmail or gmail account... that's kind of odd, but I guess is the new 'thing', anyway I think it is the way that big fishes control our space.The phone does not have the option of copy and paste the numbers of a call that was made or vice versa... in the old Nokia phones you can 'edit number&#34.In general, it is a very great phone. Is very nice, looks great, it is so simple and people will always look at you.
