The screen is beautiful. People asked about what kind of phone I have a lot of times when they saw my phone. Fast touch responses. Wonderful WiFi, I can use Xfinity WiFi free almost everywhere since I have Comcast internet at home. It's a Windows phone so you need to get use to it. Lots of free apps, and games. I play Shuffle party all the time when I am on a bus or train. Wonderful functions, and it is much cheaper than iPhone or Samsung android phones. I am very happy about it.
