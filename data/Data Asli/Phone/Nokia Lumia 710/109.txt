I bought mine about 6 months ago, not from Amazon but new from the store. It worked perfectly until this morning I was using it and it went black suddenly and it has not come back to life again. So, I researched about it to do a hard reset (which did not work at all) and I found that a lot of people have had this happen to their Nokia Lumia 710. Apparently it is a common issue. Mine is completely lifeless and unresponsive for no reason whatsoever. It is ruined. I paid over 300 dollars for it 6 months ago and now it is totally useless to me. With that being said, I do love Windows Phone, and I just ordered a Nokia Lumia 900 (against my better judgement since this Windows Phone is a lifeless carcass now). But I love the Operating System. However, I will continue to be worried when I get my 900 that the same thing will happen. Windows Phone's have a lot of software issues. I really love the Operating System, but I can not pay 300 for a new phone every few months when they just die suddenly without warning. I still can not believe it. I hope I'll have better luck with the 900, but for anyone who buys this phone, I recommend you make sure you will have at least a 12 month warranty. And I do have a 12 month warranty with Nokia, so I will send my Lumia into there to be repaired, but I had to buy a new phone in the meantime and this has been a very horrible inconvenience to me.
