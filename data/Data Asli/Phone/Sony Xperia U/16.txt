The Xperia U is a great phone that i would personally reccomend to any new smart phone user or an android user who wants a multimedia based android environment or social media practive. The device came preloaded with android 2.3 Gingerbread but a manual update on Sonys PC software can upgrade you to Android 4.0.4 I believe? If you have an active internet connection at home.I set the phone up on Straight Talk and recieved max 3g and 1x speeds on the phone. I predict the phone would do the same on T-mobile and ATT. (The phone has available to it a developer/user flash tool to flash carrier recommended firmwares to it to optimize it for the usa, overseas countries, ect)Being an Android Developer, I did recognize one flaw on the device. Once flashing the Xperia U to ICS or Android 4.0. You will notice a huge difference in performance and UI changes however, if you exceed the memory usage or cpu usage with app usage, your phone is liable to heat up, reboot, or shut off. Android 4.0 requires 512mb to run correctly, the Xperia U has 512mb of ram avaiable to it.The Phone is root-able to Root users. It has plenty of development to support many custom roms and custom modifications to support better performance. This Phone has MIUI, cm9, AOKP, and custom stock roms avaialbe to it. It also has an unlcockable bootloader for custom kernel flashing. Guides are avaialbe via XDA Developers.Features that make this phone unique from other smart phones are the following.-Sony user interface and lockscreen-Sony Walkman Player with download info features-Sony Timescape (Facebook and twitter integration)-Google Exclusive-Sony Wallpapers/Live Wallpapers-Sony Messaging-Sony Movies Application
