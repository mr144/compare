This phone does not have all of the power of newer smartphones, but it also does not have that price.it is a very stylish phone and is very snappy (it never lags on loading any programs or anything).The only weird thing is that I bought this phone after buying a Nexus 7 and the small differences between Jellybean and Gingerbread add up.Pros:-Snappy-Stylish-CheapCons:-Gingerbread-Battery life (only lasts a day if I use it for anything other than standby)A lot of smartphones do not really have much of a battery life so I would not worry about it.As a sidenote, I bought this to use on T-Mobile. I do not live in an area with 4g, however even though it does not have the 1700 band I still get 3g outside of my house and otherwise I usually get Edge, which to me is still good enough.I tested using gps and data to setup directions to somewhere and it was generally helpful. Though it seems data is used in conjunction with gps which can be problematic on a road trip in areas without coverage. Overall, I think This smartphone is still worse than iphone, lumia, HTC inspire, or atrix.
