Seemed like a decent phone. But I had to return it. The reason we bought this unlocked phone was to avoid paying for a data plan from AT&T. But it turns out that is not feasible. As long as you have a smart phone, they charge you for data plan. I was hoping to use the other features like WiFi, other Android applications, etc on this phone. But if I have to still pay $$ to AT&T for data plan, the purpose of buying an unlocked phone is defeated.  Hence the phone was returned.
