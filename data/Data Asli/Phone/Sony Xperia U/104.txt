I had a shot to this phone - and just love it!!! it is works just so smooth, fast, nice screen, speakers, cameras. Really unlocked. Could not upgrade to android 4 though. Getting error each time i am trying to, but 2.3 works just fine for me too. Plastic looks cheap though after mine Nokia  but it is ok, i prefer good work. Good phone for this price.
