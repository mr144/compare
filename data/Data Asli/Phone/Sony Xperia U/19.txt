OK, I bought this phone about 3 months ago and although it was a bit smaller than I thought, I was OK with it.But now it is nothing but trouble.Where do I start?  The battery now goes dead in about a half day (using it as only a phone anymore)Oftentimes, I hit a button to call someone and the camera comes on.Or, I try to answer the phone when it rings and it goes black on me.When trying to find a someone in my address book, it will switch to the guitar tuner.Crazy things like this over and over.I have updated to the latest version and I reboot it everyday like it says.I had a Samsung Galaxy and wanted something a little smaller.But this is not anywhere close in quality to the Samsung.I used to think that Sony products were quality.Not anymore.
