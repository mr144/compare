The phone looks and runs great but when I put in my tmobile SIM it did not let me make any calls. Went to tmobile and they said that the phone had not been unlocked properly.The return process was not bad, but I would have preferred them to send me a replacement phone first and then return the damaged phone. They asked me to return the phone by printing a shipping label they sent me and told me I would get the money refunded in about 2-3 weeks. So I returned it and ordered another one. Hopefully the next one works. I also had to pay more for the new one I ordered.One other thing I noticed was there is no SD card slot, so you are stuck with the standard storage on the phone.
