Hi,I purchased this phone as it was Unlocked. So that I could use it in India. Now, When I started using it in India, I came to know that it is not unlocked. So I am very much disappointed. Since I returned from US, the warranty will also be invalid. So I will not be able to contact any sony service center. But I had to spend more money to unlock the phone.Why is it mentioned in the product description as &#34;Unlocked&#34; when the phone is still locked. I need the unlock code for this mobile.
