I did buy 2 of this and inmediately upgrade them to ICS. After a week using them (husband and I) think they are great. Battery life is good. Plenty of customization options. Camera is pretty good considering it is only 5 megapixels. Have them with ATT prepaid plans (voice and data)and they work just great.
