Meets expectations.....nice looking, easy to handle.  Was difficult to learn to use at first but i am adjusting...When i entered a new time zone and state, the time did not change and I was unable to make calls but i learned how to power off ( which is not easy) and it allowed me to make calls..the time still did not self adjust.
