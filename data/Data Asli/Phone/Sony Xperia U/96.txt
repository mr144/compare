I am a college student, got this phone when it was on sale. I never really write reviews besides for my professors, so olease bare with mePros:Light weight, ThinI also like the light on the botton, and I like that I can change the colorThe camera takes a very clear picture, the detailed specs should be under the product page.The camera also has a stabilization fuction so the pictures are never blurryThe set up of the phone is very simpleThe camera/video light helps with darker photo taking/filmingThe camera also have different features such as the fish eye panel, which I thought was coolCons:The camera quick key is kind of hard to control because it needs to be press a little bit harder til you hear a little click for the phone to registerThe video shotting is kind of blurryWhen talking on the phone, the phone still go into the black screen and hang up after a while.While talking on the phone, the phone press fuction is not turned off ( maybe I just do not know how to do it), because of that I always accidentally press the speaker or mute button.I am a RPG gamer, so I play games on my phone, but sometimes it freezes or crashes. But it could also be that the games are in testing stage, so it is just not stable with Android phones.I hope this review can help anyone who is looking for a phone
