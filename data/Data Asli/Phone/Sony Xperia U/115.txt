I got this phone for $160 from Amazon lightning deal and I am very happy with this purchase.Pros,Size: phone is small so it is very convenient to carry aroundScreen: screen is visible outside under sunlight. Touchscreen is very responsive.System upgradable: overall it is a good experience. It took me about 20 mins to upgrade. Although I did notice some 1-2secs lags after upgrading, that is totally acceptable for me.Battery life: for moderate-heavy use (call, text, web browsing and app downloading), my phone lasts me a day and a half, which is great. Note you can also buy a replace battery from eBay for around 10 dollars.Cons,The bottom LED light: it is a battery drainer although I like the idea. I have no idea how to turn it completely off.Storage: only 4GB available.Camera: speed is way too slow! It took like 3sec to turn on camera and 5sec to take a picture. I will never take pictures using this phone. Also I have no idea how the dedicated camera bottom worksOverall this is a great basic smartphone
