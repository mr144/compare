Dual core makes it blazing fast; Xperia theme is well designed; build quality is great--makes it feel like a high end phone; best unlocked phone for the money. Camera is passable (not amazing) and the lack of expandable storage / small 4gb space are the only caveats.Excellent if you are looking for a small, but robust and fast smart phone
