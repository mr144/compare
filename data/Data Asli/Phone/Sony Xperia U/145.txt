I bought this phone for my daughter to use on StraightTalk with 3G. Works perfectly and it amazing how Sony can sell this at almost $200 when the phone has dual core processor, great screen, and very stylish transparent bar that changes colors while viewing galleries and for notifications. I played with it briefly and it performs way better than my Xperia Arc with no lag whatsoever and the size is about perfect for most females and kids.Like all Sony (and SE) phones this one also comes with pre-applied screen protector already PLUS they put in an extra screen protector in the package along with micro-SIM to SIM adapter + an extra color bottom cap for the phone. My daughters white phone came with Yellow cap. You can also buy additional bottom caps in different colors.There is really nothing to complain about this phone at this price point. But, if I have to, I did say microSD card slot would have made this even cooler.
