Phone looks beautiful and the android OS is amazing. But, the main purpose of the smartphone is the ability to use the internet from the phone. And there comes the problem. Wifi DOES NOT WORK. I tried all possible ways including spending couple hrs to update the Android OS. I heard it is a common problem in this model..but I am not sure. There are some many 5 star ratings so I guess I got a lemon. So I had no choice but to return it.
