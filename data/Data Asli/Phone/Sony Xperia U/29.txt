I bought it for my wife, so that she can make the transition from a Blackberry 9780. This product is a lot better than blackberry. It came in a box directly from sony, it has an interchangeable tip so you can change it between a wihite or yellow tip.The sysop is ice cream sandwich but using the Sony PC Companion you can upgrade it to Jelly Bean in an hour or so.Very good camera you can even yake panoramic photos, Skype works perfectly, with this phone you can open a Box account and have it upgrade to a 50Gb for life.it is a little thinner and lighter than my Iphone 4s, if i did not had the Iphone i would by one for me.Its perfect for people who does not like big phones, i does almost same things that a S2, S3 or a I4s do.The downside, if you have the geolocation enabled the battery lasts about 4 hrs, but with mi Iphone 4s its almos the same.Good buy
