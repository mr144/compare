I bought this one for my wife because she wanted a smartphone but did not want anything flashy or expensive. When I put it in my hands it feels cheap and light. it is made of cheap plastic and the battery will not last a whole day without charging if you use the phone frequently. My wife is uses the phone occasionally so it is fine for her and she's on prepaid. I would not recommend this phone for heavy users. I used to be a big fan of Sony but not anymore.
