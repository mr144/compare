Had it for about 1 month...got the ICS upgrade...nothing to complain really, excellent product. Totally recommend...PROS: affordable price, smooth control of everything, apps work great.CONS: the back material feals cheap, but thats ok for me. The screen is a little small for my taste but thats why the offer other products.conclusion: really liked it, if you can get it and do not want to spend much in a cellphone, this is the one to get.
