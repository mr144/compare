The phone itself is beautiful, the Xperia software with android which is upgradable to 4.0 is really slick and visually pleasing. Built in dual core processor at 1GHZ makes navigating quite pleasing adding on to the device's aesthetics.HOWEVER.-This device does not operate on T-Mobile USA's 3G networks. It will only pick up T-Mobile's EDGE networks which is much much slower. (and yes, i did make sure the APN settings were correct)-This device DOES NOT HAVE A MEMORY CARD SLOT... Seriously... its 2012-2013... why are mobile devices classed as smartphones assembled without memory card slots.I wanted to love it... i really did... but these two issues are fairly large and glaring ones that keep me personally from loving this device.
