I bought this phone as a birthday gift for my little sister but I did not like at all!!The font size is too small .. I barely see it and there is no option for larger font sizes!The system and messaging font is small. The camera does not look like a 5MP as we used to see in previous sony products!I am returning this product and I do not recommend it for anyone! I am buying Xperia P as exchange ... once I receive it, I'll post a review on it!it is simple for little ones and cheap but it is going to hurt their eyes because of the very small font size!
