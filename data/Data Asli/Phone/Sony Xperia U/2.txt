the phone had a nice feel and the screen appeared to be what i was looking for, but i never really got a chance to try it out.  the language it was set for in the Android os was Romanian, and the seller did not bother to wipe the unlock code.  due to both issues, the phone was a worthless paperweight... the Amazon folks should do a better job of verifying that this type of produce is usable.  it wastes my time when this happen..
