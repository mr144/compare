I loved the phone's design and features, yet did not like that I was not able to access data on it. I understand it is an unlocked phone but the seller specified that the phone was compatible to my phone carrier. I only used it a couple of months since I was not able to use my data plan that I was paying for. I just bought another phone, instead.
