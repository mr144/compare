Phone worked OK with Android 2.3 on it. Then I made the mistake of upgrading to 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich). Ever since, it has been extremely slow. I have tried changing every setting I can think of but still not good. If I had upgraded earlier, Amazon would probably have let me return it but I am past the deadline now.If anyone has fixed this problem, please email me at bradmburke@gmail.com. Thanks in advance. I am desparate.
