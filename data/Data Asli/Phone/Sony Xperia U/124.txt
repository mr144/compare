Alright - the phone's specifications are good for a med-priced smartphone, the camera is powerful and unlike some other manufacturers, the phone is plug n'play, making file transfers quick and easy. Screen resolution is sweet.And that was my whole 1 hour experience with the phone.You see, after an hour, the phone gave me an alert that the battery had to charge. I put it to charge. After 4 hours the phone did not charge. It was dead. Went on Sony's website and tried to see if anyone else had similar problems (apparently I was not alone). The phonerefused to charge and refused to switch on. Sad really but I think Sony made a dud here. (I have had nine phones and ALL have been Sony's - they usually take ALOT of pounding and torture before failing).BTW -  sent it back to Amazon and got a refund, no questions asked. Really, really good customer service, especially considering I returned the phone not from the States but from the Caribbean. On Amazon's part - really impressive (hence a star).I'll try another Sony phone though, the brand has been good in the past to me and one bad egg is not enough to make me write them off completly. Another bad phone well....
