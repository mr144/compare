This is a very good cell phone.. I love it.  The camera its really nice but if u are in a room with a little amount of light, the picture is gonna have some noice, at first it was very annoying but once you know the right configurations to use it, it will be easy to always get a pretty nice pictures. For the price is the best choice but if u can get a htc or a samsung you should go for it. ( With samsung or htc i mean recent devices.. i tried a samsung galaxy s2 and it was a little faster than this sony )
