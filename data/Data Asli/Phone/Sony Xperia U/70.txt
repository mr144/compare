Unlocked phones are the best! So far the screen has not had any scratches since I took off the screen guard I had on it and it is been about 3 months since I did that. It does good for what it does. Although it does have it is down fall. Has a good camera for recording and taking pictures if it is not blurry (caused by the lighting of a room). I love the xloud feature, because it is loud when it is enable - especially for the alarm. There's a lot of mini features that they have that makes it very sutomiziable which I like.When you change orientation for the screen it takes it a few seconds to swtich. The glow at the bottom is cool at sometimes and sometimes it is just annoying -  I wish I could turn it off. (But it looks cool). Sometimes it freezes on me and I have to remove the battery in the back - which is very easy to do. Battery life is not as good if your a heavy internet or gaming user. However it does not take long to charge the battery. Less than an hour and your battery will be full. Another way to solve your over use of battery power is to use the energy save mode they offer. Very efficent, why not have it on all the time?
