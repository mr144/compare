Great feelings. Smartphone Box, Body, screen, weight , led bar, speaker sound. Great screen resolution. Sony TimeScape UI + WalkmanPlay on Device (via DLNA on my WDTV, nice to view picture with my kids)GingerBread is good but ICS it is Great (Data control, face unlock, delay to lock phone, intuitive menus, etc, )Support USB OTG (do not care about microsd slot missing)
