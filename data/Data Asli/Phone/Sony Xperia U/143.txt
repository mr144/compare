it is nice and affordable. The price tag was the number one reason that I got this phone.  I thought it was a great deal compared to other phones with similar specs.The software runs smoothly. I have to remember to type  with my finger tips and not my nails. I wish Sony would hurry with the Android update to 4.0. The battery last a day for me (the Joys of a smartphone). I believe the internal memory is adequate for me since, I can always transfer files to my Galaxy Tab for storage.I have been using it for 10 days and I love it.UPDATEI stopped using this phone in Jan 2013. One night it decided not to charge and the phone would not turn on. Then certain areas of the screen were becoming unresponsive and I decided it was time to get rid of it and get a Samsung S3.  This was my first Sony, it was a cute phone but I do not think I would buy another Sony again.
