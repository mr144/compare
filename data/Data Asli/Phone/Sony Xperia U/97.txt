My kids love this phone.  Unlocked, low cost, new (not branded by any carrier) being used in low cost family plan tmobile.  Keep their most important music, fm radio, good camera with flash, unlimited texting, gmail sychronized contacts, and wifi that allows you to have a limited small data plan or no data plan needed since we have wifi at home, schools, and work. Small to fit in their pockets but not tiny.  Complete android Google phone experience.
