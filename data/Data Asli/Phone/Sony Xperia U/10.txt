This review is according to my wife.  She told me that Sony Xperia was the best phone made.  I chuckled since i have a HTC One X.  She states the phone is fast and accomplishes any task she throws at it. It is small and she does not need anything else. This while she is typing on her Tablet.  I said it is only 3G how can it be the best phone ever. She can use it in any country as it is a unlocked phone. We have put this to test in a couple different countries and  yes it works great.  I still say it is not better than a 4G phone.  If you are not looking for super fast do everything phone, then this will work for you.  As she states.  SHE LOVES THIS phone.
