The phone looked good, was visually appealing, and easy to use. The major problem I encountered was that the phone was defective. After a few hours of use, I discovered that I was unable to make an outgoing call without first turning the phone off and then turning it back on again. The phone would work well and then the problem would start again. I also learned from friends that they had attempted to call me, but were unable to reach me during the periods when the phone randomly stopped working. I ended up returning it after one day of use. Amazon, as always, was great and promptly refunded my money upon return.
