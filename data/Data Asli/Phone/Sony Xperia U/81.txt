I have used this phone for about 3 months and it is a good device that is upgradeable to Android version 4.0.4.  I started out with version 2.3 and upgraded a couple of weeks ago.  Since then the phone seems to have a longer battery life and is even better (faster & more responsive and reliable).  This is the second Android-based phone I have purchased this year and this one was a better choice.Like:- Solid, reliable and fast performance- Responsive touch user interface with Sony UI features and support for Android ICS (4.04)- Good phone reception and wifi connectivity works well for downloads and web browsingDislike:- GPS is not the best as I use Nike+ and it has trouble picking up a signal (indoors or out)- Camera is not the best for pictures using the digital zoom and pictures can come out grainy looking, otherwise pics look good using flash- Requires  Windows based software to use certain application features and for updating the phone software- No SD card slot for external memory expansion (I do not expect to load lots of apps, music or videos on the phone though).Recommendation:A pretty good option for moderate smartphone use and fits with budget conscious consumers who would like a decent Android phone experience.  I will consider a Sony phone in the future as the company is a reputable manufacturer that provides good support for Android upgrades.  I would like to see if there will be an upgrade path to Jelly Bean for this device.
