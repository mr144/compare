My husband and I bought this phone because he had a Sony phone in the past and it was his favorite phone. We purchased this phone because it was an unlocked phone and we put T-Moblie 50.00 unlimited service/ no contract and we are very pleased. It is updating through the computer and it is a very fast phone. The price was right and it does even more than the I Phone at a much lower price. We both recommend this phone.
