I bought it because I love the look, but the phone gets very worm with several minutes of use. worst part is even when I stay at the same spot, the signal can change from 4bar to no signal, so I had many dropped calls.After I came out of basement which has no signal, the phone will not search for signal, so I have to restart it in order to have service again, very anoying.  I have it for less than a month, but unforturnally I threw away all packaging on the 1st day so I can not return it.
