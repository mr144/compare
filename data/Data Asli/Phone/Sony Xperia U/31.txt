When I first got this phone I was excited. Screen looks amazing. Easy to switch languages it seemed at first. But the longer I had it, the more it seemed hard to work with - texting is horrid on these phones.  I have a touch and sending messages is easy - these phones are awful. Does not get a good signal for phone or internet. Have to randomly turn off then on to get it to work at times. As with many phones now it is a pain to get it to charge. Have to wiggle the plug and hope it charges properly. When I first got mine and I got my mom another Sony phone - I was very impressed. Like I said screen is beautiful - great colors, seemed to work well - but the longer we have had them the more I wish I had just bought a Google Nexus. Overall just not impressed and wish I could just get my money back.
