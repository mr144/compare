I bought this phone unsure if it would work for me because everyone on here complains that it does not work with at&t. But as i mentioned before it is working with tigo in PARAGUAY (850/1900). For the price it is a pretty good phone, how ever it does have some lagging, especially after theupdate to ics. If you have money to spear i would recommend xperia p or s.
