The OS on it zips especially when updated to Jelly Bean. However, the experience was hindered with the small screen. The keyboard was too narrow and uncomfortable to use (installed 3rd party one and it worked better) The buttons (home / menu / back) were an annoyance to get to work over the translucent bar. Everything else worked fine. Themes were fun that went along with customizing the phone to your personality. The OS worked as expected so no complaints their. The camera could have been better for this model in comparison to previous models. Hence, it was OK overall.
