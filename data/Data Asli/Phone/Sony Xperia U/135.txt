I had a Nokia 5800, it was a good phone but I was looking for an Android Phone and for the price this is the best you can get.This phone is amazing, beatutiful, fast, excellent screen resolution, very good camera, it has all that you will need.with a larger battery it would be perfect, I do not' need more memory, it is a cell phone not a tab.I have mine with Claro in Dominican Republic, it works flawless, very fast and stable.
