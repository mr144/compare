This is my first smarphone. And I really like it. Screen responsiveness is great. Perceived quality is very good. Battery lasts for 2 or 3 days, if I do not use too much internet.It comes with the usb conector / recharger, a protective screen (Sony should also supply their tablets with those, they are great). The light bar at the bottom is useless in my opinion.
