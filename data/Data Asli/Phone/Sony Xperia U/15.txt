Battery time is only a few hours. I am the sort of person who does not use phone very frequqntly or listen to music, watch videos or surf internet over the phone. Still by the team I return home from work, the battery is already dead. The processor is also really slow. I bought it during a promotion and it sat around for a few months before I started using it. Now I am just past the date that I could have returned it. Do not buy this phone!
