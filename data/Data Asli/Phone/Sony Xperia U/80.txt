This is a great android phone.I use the phone for 2 month now. With 4.0.1 It is now actually more than I need. I had to give this only 4 Stars though, because I had to call the service once to recover it from a fatal breakdown directly after I turned it on for the first time! After that is always did a good job and I only have positive things to report. Actually even the support was nice and helpful.The thing that really impressed me is the very good sound of this phone. It actually ended up replacing my iPod as the sound is the sound seems just better to me and it is comfortable to have one device less with you.I also like the display that was a big step forward after my htc aria. The comparison to the iPhone ends as usual. If you do not want to have the phone that everyone has, you think the iPhone is to expensive, and you like to actually put hand on the software of your electronics yourself, this is the better phone. You also save money, by the way and get an a bit more compact device.
