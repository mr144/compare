This product was not at all what I thought it was going to be. Spent nearly $200 on a phone that feels very cheap. Not to mention-it freezes, kicks you out of apps, and drops call-ALL THE TIME. Unfortunately, I missed the warranty return by 3 days.. Long story short; the phone came repackaged in bubble wrap & the screen protector that came as promised, was bent to hell. Although, I think this phone would be good for a first time smart phone buyer such as a teenager. Other than that, do not buy this phone.
