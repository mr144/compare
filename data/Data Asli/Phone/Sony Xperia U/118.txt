Awesome and smooth performance with the upgrading to Android 4.04... however I will not give 5 stars cause the frame of the touch screen is very fragile... that piece of the device is getting ugly only one month right after starting its usage... now that frame's got a couple of little cracks... and I still do not know how that happened... shame I can not claim for the guarantee as I am out of US now... This is really dissapointing... SonyEricsson watch out the finishings of the new Xperia U!!!
