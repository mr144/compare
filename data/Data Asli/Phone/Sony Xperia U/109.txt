I got this phone to replace a very old Motorola flip phone (i.e. not a smart phone). I popped in my Verizon chip and the phone came right up. Even though I do not have a data plan for that phone, this new phone is much better for texting than the tap-method on a conventional phone. The camera is much better quality, it is much easier to enter new contacts, and even without a data plan, all of the data functions work using wifi. So that's a nice benefit, as well.I bought this as a Lightening deal, so got it at a very good price. Since I did not want to end up with a new 1- or 2-year contract from Verizon, I specifically wanted to avoid buying a phone from them. This was a great solution, and I am really pleased to have taken a chance on it.
