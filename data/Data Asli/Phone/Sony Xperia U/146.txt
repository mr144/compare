So far so good. I definitely like this phone! I am using it with Straight Talk with full 3G capabilities. ALSO, you do not need to buy a separate screen protector, it already came with one! If I knew, I would have not bought one separately. To my surprise the unit also came with a micro-SIM adapter since the phone uses the standard size SIM card.
