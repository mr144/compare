I have only had this phone for a day. First impressions are:Screen: it is bright and nice. Not as nice as my previous Nokia E7 (About 4 inches), but good enough for a $200 phone.Processor: Brilliant. Quick and responsive. Android 4.0 running now and all apps work as a breeze. Words with Friends, Draw Something, and Facebook messenger running together with no lag. My friends with iPhones have told me that this phone is quicker than theirs.OS: Android Ice Cream Sandwich. Good.Battery: The battery does not last 'long'. By long I mean I played games all day and the battery was out by 2 AM. I do not think any other phone would have lasted longer though (definitely lasts longer than any i device)Camera: Is not that great compared to my Nokia E7 (8 MP). But, still okay. Nothing too bad.
