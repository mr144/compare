My daughter was absolutely in love with the phone.  she love the sleek design.  She loved this fancy light at the bottom.  She was thrilled.  the only problem was nowhere in the information for the phone did it say it was not compatible with certain carriers.  We had Verizon.  It does not work with Verizon.  So back it went.  Collosal waste of time.
