What a great phone, I was looking for something new, modern, fun, elegant, and sophistic.This is the phone, its actually and medium end device by the new generation of Sony smartphones, but this is one is what great for anyone looking for something catchy, durable and well made. Sony created a phone no so expensive like the others brothers from same family, this one has what you need on any smartphone, It will keep updated and you will be able to do all you need on today world.1- Is fast and works smooth on any application2- Ready to be updated to new android is fantastic, no bugs no problems at all.3- Has an interesting durable, fancy and resistant material on case, looks good, feels good.4- The screen has everything you need, bright, deep contrast, great sutured colors, HD. Not really great for finger prints marks but is very resistant for scratch... If you buy some screen protector you do not have to worry for dust or finger prints.5- Yeap I know just 8 gb internal memory, but thats enough for apps music, HD Photos and more, not a bad thing.6- The camera works great and does the job not really fancy but what you need for you phone at any good moment.7- Very sensitive at touch works fast.8- Very personalized, the light on the bottom and the changeable cap is very cool.UPDATE ( August 22, 20 days of use)The phone is amazing, after all this time, I have no complains about it. No bugs, No problems.I want to add something about the battery, this phone has a battery Standard battery, Li-Ion of 1320 mAh (not a big issue), do not know why they did not put something better, but is ok, if you install some apps like: Defender Juice and specially Easy Battery Saver, any android phone will last longer, like twice the time. This one last about One day or two days; I use Skype, whats-app, badoo, news apps, weather widgets and more, so all together are battery drainers.Still happy!I recommend it for today's price and quality, and of course functionality.Final update September 19!  No complains works amazing!
