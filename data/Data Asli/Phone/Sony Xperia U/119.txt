Purchased the phone for my husband.  Calls keep dropping or the calls do not go through.  One has to consistently restart the phone for the calls to go through which was very annoying.  Contacted Sony and was given suggestions to do updates for software but still having the same issue.  Slick looking phone but functioning sucks! Not a problem with the carrier.  What is the point of getting a phone where the calls do not get through?? Very disappointed.
