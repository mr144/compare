Bought it for a week then returned, I experienced some lags and the camera button on the side is not working so well, photos are not impressed, screen is very sharp, nothing else impressed me, only edge speed for data if you have contract with T-mobile. I only care smartphones about the camera, gps and signal qualities, maybe some website browsing if going out, so I ordered a Nokia N8 instead.
