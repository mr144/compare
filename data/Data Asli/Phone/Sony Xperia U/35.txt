I bought this phone just a few days back. I like the look and design of the phone at this price point. However I got an error message &#34;Emergency calls only&#34; on the phone even when the network tower symbol is available on the screen.When i tried place a call it simply got disconnected without any response. I was able to make calls only after rebooting. I have noticed this issue a couple of times. The battery back-up is not good on this phone. I have made a few changes to overcome these deficiencies and continue to test this for couple of weeks because everything else is quite impressive about this set considering the specs and price.
