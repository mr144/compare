I bought this phone for my cousin because it is Sony, and all those positive reviews. It is &#34;small&#34; compare with today's standard. But it feels good when holding. The display was blinking like an old TV without signal at the first set up.Then my cousin complains it is not turning on after charge, and have to restart it to reconnect to service.I believe it is fine product for it received 4.5 stars from users. But I will not give it another try. Wish Amazon will give me a full refund so we can choose another phone.
