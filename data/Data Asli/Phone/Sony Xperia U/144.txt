i just got this in the mail and it comes with a few little informational booklets and a screen protector, charger, usb cord, the headset attachment and the interchangeable black or white bottom cases. It is a little phone i was expecting a little more. The screen is very small but overall the phone works very well. It is very fast and although the ablility to use a memory card has been taken, i think i have more than enough space on this phone. hope this helps.
