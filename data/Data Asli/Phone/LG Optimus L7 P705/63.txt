I never used it but my wife loves it .. she can not keep her face out of it . But I must the optimus l7 is for the average android user, its not a power house . occasional web browsing pushing emails and modern gaming is pretty much good this phone is good for.the sensor in the phone is really strong she has a ok signal everywhere she goes even out in Royal areas.
