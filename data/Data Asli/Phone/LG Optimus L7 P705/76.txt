This phone is amazing. it is like a mini laptop.The multitude of aplications downloaded on the phone keep me in touch with the world -weather, news, email, facebook...Its internal memory it is so big that i can download movies, i can record videos and still have enough memory for games or applications.It has lots of themes, lockers, widgets..I just love it, i would not trade it for an iphone.
