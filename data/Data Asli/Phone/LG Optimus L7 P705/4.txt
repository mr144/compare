I would recommend this product.  I bought this for my son and he loves it.  The only thing a customer should know is that you would need wi-fi to access your internet.  My son had no problem actually finding an app to get access to the internet.  The next thing (which is sort of minor) you have to change it to the English language as the instructions are not English.  The main point is, the phone does what it is suppose to do you just have to adjust one or two things.  Shipping was quick also.  I recommend.
