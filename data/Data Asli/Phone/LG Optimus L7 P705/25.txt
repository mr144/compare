the phone is pretty good, the screen is so sharp and bright despite its cost, a little laggy but is the most I could expect from the money spended.the only huge problem I could not handle is the 3g connection, I have only been able to use 2g slow network from T-mobile, I tried with a T-mobile Sim card and another AT&T simcard but none of them worked in 3g velocity. Probably the problem is on the configuration of the phone, but I have been trying to contact customer service and they do not answer the phone, I'll try to configure and update if I manage to connect it.
