When my Samsung Galaxy s3 got stolen and I wouldn&#8217;t spend that much money in a phone again so I went with this option and I am very satisfied.  Is a wonderful phone, is fast and has a good style (and I am comparing it to the Galaxy s3) the camera isn&#8217;t the best but its pretty good at the end. The thing is: its a great phone for the price you pay!
