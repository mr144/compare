This is one of the best purchases I have made.I wanted a large screen (4.3 '),thin(just over 1/4') and easy to use.I got all of these things in a GSM phone that I was able to use with the SIM card from Consumer Cellular. It connected flawlessly right out  of the box. I am one of those old guys (85) so you know it had to be easy. I had to ask my youngest son for help to set up a Google A/C but that's it. I know there are a lot more things I'll be able to do in the future and I'll probably be trying many of them. I am so pleased with this phone that I got a white one for my wife.For the price I think they are great.
