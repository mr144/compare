This phone blocks you (the majority of the time) from using the SD card.  The phone's interal memory is in a folder called '/sdcard' that 'tricks' programs into installing everything onto the phone memory.  Good luck getting around this without rooting.  I bought this phone and a 32 GB SD card.  Currently my SD card has 30 GB free.  THIRTY.  I can put music on it if I manually transfer, but I CANNOT move apps to it and it is nearly impossible to adjust apps like Podcatchers or Cameras to save to the true SD card, because they all default to saving to the /sdcard folder on the phone's hard drive and even if you modify the settings to not do this, most of the time they reset to the default after a phone restart.  Oh, and the phone's hard drive is 1.8 GBs and constantly fills up if you actually enjoy downloading/trying new apps.  Are you used to moving apps to your SD card to save space on your phone's memory?  Sorry, no-can-do on this gem!  They'll just transfer to the phone memory.All in all, those phone is junk.  It runs super slow if you install a decent amount of apps or want to keep photos and videos.  And to top it off, the speaker phone is in an odd spot.JUNK JUNK JUNK just get a galaxy or an iPhone.  It's always appealing to try and save a few bucks and get the knockoff, but learn from my mistake and stick with the tried and true top phones.Also, I attempted to email LG, but their contact process involves signing up for an LG account (YES!  I have always wanted one!), and then the form you fill out to complain locks you out of actually sending it.  Trust me.  Please try it.  My head almost blew up.Okay I am done venting for now.  To summarize, LG is a clunky junky 4th rate electronics company and will always be just that. This smartphone is worse than blackberry, xperia, HTC, Motorola, Nokia, iphone, etc.  That's why you see their products at Big Lots.
