Many users have said that this phone does not work with Mobile data networks(3G and 2G). It's absolutely true.I ordered the phone and ignored other comments that this phone does not connect 3G and 2G networks and ended up losing$10 to ship the phone back. I tried the sim cards from AT&T and T-Mobile and none of them worked. Only voice worked. I do believe that the sellers are well aware of this problem but they will sell you the phone hopping that people will accept the phone as is.Conclusion, this is what you get when you try to go cheap. You will end up wasting your time and in my case losing money.Spend an additional $100 or $150 and you will be happy. For example, the Nexus 4 costs $300 or the iPhone 4 costs $450 which comes unlocked. You can buy the iPhone 4 unlocked directly from the Apple web site.
