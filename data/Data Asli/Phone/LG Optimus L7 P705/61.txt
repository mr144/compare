Upon my initial receipt, I was unable to provide a thorough review, as it was a Christmas gift for my tween.  Once activated on the T-Mobile network, and given a chance to test it thoroughly (voice, email, web and apps), I have nothing but the best to say about this phone.  It performs great, has great sound quality and has many great extras to play around with.  The screen is clear and smooth to touch commands.  I highly reccomend this phone.  In fact, I ordered one for myself, as it is a great deal vs. having to pay a high price to upgrade with my carrier.
