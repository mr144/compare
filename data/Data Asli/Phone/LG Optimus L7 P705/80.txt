It's a little bit more than 'just another android cell. It's big, it is fast and beautiful! It takes nice shots, has a large internal memory and gives a great overall experience.The negatives are the basic quality for capturing video, it is all plastic, although battery is a bit more efficient I, personally , did not feel it lasted a lot more.I might update my review later.
