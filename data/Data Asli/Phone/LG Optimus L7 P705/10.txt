Comfortable to hold, elegant, good screen resolution and speed, nice colors. Very good mid range telephone at affordable price. Recommended. Contact the seller prior to purchase if you need Spanish language as mine came with lot of Eastern languages but not Spanish. Used in Venezuela with Movilnet with no problems.
