I have had this phone for a little over a month now. The phone cannot find the 4g that comes with my network service (T-Mobile) and since I bought the phone unlocked, I tried to put another sim card with a different company (AT&T) it still could not find the 4g or 3g. Also, the phone does not automatically remember the WiFi setting and if the screen goes to sleep, I will either have to wait for it to find the WiFi again or start it back up manually/ When trying to download more than one app or play a game/Facebook while trying to download something in the background, the phone runs slower. When trying to use the zoom on the camera, the photos do not come out very well. On the upside, the sleek look & light weight make for easy carrying and the screen is HUGE (but watching attempting to watch Netflix with the app is a joke!) I love the shortcuts and all other features on the phone & for the price (~$220 + unlocked/no warranty) it is a good bang for your buck, but in today's high-end Smart Phone world, I would not recommend purchasing this phone.
