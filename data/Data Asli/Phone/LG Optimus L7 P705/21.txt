Not only is the phone great, the service from Hasslefreecell was absolutely fantastic!  I have been unable to connect to the data plan (Consumer Cellular which piggybacks on AT&T).  The representatives at Hasslefreecell worked with me until it DID work.  I really like all of the features of this Android phone (4.0 - ICS) and certainly appreciate all of the efforts and patience from Hasslefreecell.  I highly recommend the phone, and especially recommend the vendor.
