My first impression of the phone is that its really pretty and slim. I like the way it feels on my hand; light but the texture in the back makes it feel durable. One of the best thing about getting this phone is that it offers free wifi so you do not have to commit into a data plan with every other smartphone out there. I am always surrounded in wifi at phone, school, and atlanta is just swarming with hotspots for wifi. I got this phone for $120 when I signed a new contract my with tmobile dealer. You will not generally find this phone in most tmobile stores though. We went to an asian tmobile store that offers international phones.Anyways its been like two days since I have played around with this beauty. Lemme get down to business. You will not be happy watching video on this. The resolution is crap. Pictures are okay and the icecream sandwich wallie is really nice. I read several reviews about how slow the internet is being that the receptor for the wifi is made for the asian market. This is true. Initially it was crap slow. You can make it alot faster by changing the wifi setting to GMS & CDMA. There is three option for either or and both. After changing that setting I noticed the internet speed was moving a lot faster.If you are not on a data plan make sure to disable the data roaming option.  Every once in a while the phone does get glitchy but overall for the price I guess its a really great phone. There are tons of apps preloaded in there. You can also registered for the LG smartworld but its not required once you tap into the android market. The email was frustrating to set up at first but I think that was due to the laggy wifi. PolarisOffice can open PDFs yay *happy dance* Transfering music, pictures, and files into the phone is relatively easy.Overall I am really happy with my phone.
