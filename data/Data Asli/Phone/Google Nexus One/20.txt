I have used the Nexus One every day since January 2010.  The phone is still on its original battery, which lasts nearly a full day with normal phone usage (calls, email, and texting).  I am running cyanogenmod 7.2.0.  This phone has no problem running just about any current android productivity apps as of March 2013 (can not comment on gaming performance).  I would not buy one today at the listed price when the Nexus 4 is so much better (March 2013) except as a collector's item, but this phone will hold me over until the next Nexus phone with a better camera than Nexus 4 is released this year.Rated 5 stars in 2010.  Currently (March 2013) rated 3 stars because it is no longer a competitive device if you are looking for a new phone.
