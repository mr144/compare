This is my first android ever and I must say it rocks. It's just working perfect, I cannot find anything that freaks me out in this phone. Everything is just like it should be. Fast, responsive, reliable, long-life battery (first day the battery ran out quickly, even after full charge, but when I next day charged it, I played Drag racing online via wi-fi almost the whole day and the battery was still green). For sure, you will not get a better deal for this price.
