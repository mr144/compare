Hi,I brought 'Google Nexus One Unlocked Phone with Android--U.S. Warranty (Brown)' from this seller. Right after few days of buying my phone started hanging when I used to talk. It continued for some days. I did the factory reset and it got fine but again started.  Then the headphone stopped working. I tried to manage even without headphone. Then slowly a new problem started - The phone started giving trouble while charging. It continued for few days and then it does not charge at all. I tried all different chargers. But it is not charging. I spent almost $300 for the phone and it did not even last for 5-6 months. I am not rough user of phone. My uses are hardly 20-30 minutes each day. But then also it did not last. I am disappointed.I do not want to give bad feedback and spoil somebody's name but at the same time I do not want people to spend money on bad products.
