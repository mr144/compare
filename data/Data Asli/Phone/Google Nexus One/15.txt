I feel your loss if you did not buy it from Google. I bought my first one from Google.I recently had a couple of Wi-Fi errors scare. (I bought an HTC One X but could not love it. the phone is better than torch, iphone, curve, xperia, LG or Samsung phone. I bought another Nexus One from Fry's Electronics. The screen was bad; bright light at the bottom left-hand corner.Exchanged it for another one. The second one was flashed with an OS with Asiatic characters. (?!?)Nevertheless both of appeared to be returns/refurbished. Fry's tried to sell them as new. Fry's buyers need to be spanked.
