The phone worked beautifully for the month that I had the device working. It was running Android software 2.2.1 and then eventually updated to Android 2.3.4. However the screen ended up crapping out on me with no physical damage to the phone. So I called up HTC and discovered that the phone was Canadian and the US HTC Center would not fix the phone. They gave me Videotron's number to have my phone fixed, however I called videotron and they could not help me at all. So now I have a broken phone that I can not get serviced anywhere in North America. So if you live in the United States you will not have a warranty on this device. I am gonna try and get a refund through Amazon
