I just received this phone and I am very happy with it - with a couple of caveats.  The build quality is typical HTC - near perfect - and the screen is superb.  And, finally, I have an Android phone with decent battery life.  I have both the Desire HD, with awful battery life, and a Desire Z which is only moderately better.  I fully charged mine upon receiving it, and have used it for three+ hours, and it was at 71% when I just checked it this morning after having it on standby overnight.  Couple of issues though - but still a five-star rating:  Mine came with Android 2.2 and an over the air update is not available (at least in Germany where I live) to upgrade it to Android 2.3/Gingerbread.  And, the touch screen is less responsive as my other HTC phones let alone my iPhones.  This problem is not a deal-breaker - but I wish someone had mentioned it earlier.  One minor potential issue is how easily the battery cover slides up and off - probably not a major issue but be aware that it slides off fairly easily.  I have seen some complaints about the quality of the Nexus One's being sold lately. Mine came from The OEM Shop (via Amazon) and it was in absolutely new condition with US accessories.  Last, but not least, I ordered this phone in order to have a less expensive phone (all of my other HTC phones and iPhones have been over $500) to take on my walks without fear of breaking the bank if I drop it or lose it.  It fills this need perfectly.*************************** EDITED ON JUNE 8, 2011 TO ADD LONGER TERM IMPRESSIONS ************************************I have had this phone for almost two weeks now and I continue to be thrilled with it - especially given that it is quite a bit less expensive than newer (but also very nice!) HTC phones.  The battery life continues to impress me - I can get 2 and 1/2 days with data turned on - which is impressive compared to my Desire Z.  I have not had any problems connecting to both my hidden and visible wireless access points at home - and I have easily connected to free wireless at two locations on my current job trip in Germany.  I have to say though that I really miss HTC Sense - especially the weather/clock widget - and I am still irritated that I can not download Android 2.3.x here in Germany.  I have downloaded Angry Birds Rio and Plants-vs-Zombies and both play great and playing either of them does not take too much battery life.  I am convinced that for the price you cannot go wrong with this phone and continue to highly recommend it.
