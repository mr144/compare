Ok no fanboy stuff here, real customer who bought an Android here because one of my coworker who is an Android fanboy sold me.I was happy with it, for like 4 months.Afterwards things started to break down. Android would randomly shut down, Google Nav and Map dying randomly, random lock ups. So I factory reset the phone. Guess what 3G network no longer works.Went to a friend who works for Android development, who told me typical Android phone would be lucky to last for one year. Well mine lasted for 7 months before breaking down.Talked to other friends who has Nexus One, all said it start to break down after like a year.I am going to throw this away and get an iPhone, which is supposed to last longer (I hope at least, and I hate Apple products).Also y u mad lol
