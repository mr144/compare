I think Android version 2.3.4 -Gingerbread- is now public for Nexus One.  And, there is no need to follow all these how-to-upgrade websites out there. My system just progressed to 2.3.4 on its own.  Anyway, I did not see real big differences. Even, the numeric telephone keypad looked nicer with the old software version - froyo.  It was just hype.Let me tell you I love this phone.
