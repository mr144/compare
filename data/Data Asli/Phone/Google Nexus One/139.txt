After the horror of using the Symbian-run Nokia N97 for eight months, I finally threw it against a wall and went to Google.com to buy the Nexus One. This phone is heaven! The touch screen is very responsive; the phone is quick and the programs load and close in an instant. The latest Android update gave this phone tethering capability and an option to use the N1 as a Wi-Fi hot spot, as well as, Flash player! I will not bore everyone here by writing about the specifications of the device, as it is well mentioned in other reviews. The best feature about this phone is its Google talk app and the Navigation. The GPS is super fast in obtaining a signal, 1000% better than my horrid Nokia device.The things that need improving on the N1, but do not subtract much from its greatness, is as follows:1. The trackball: the trackball is not very functional. When typing or selecting text, the trackball is extremely inaccurate and will jump around the text no matter how dexterous I was.2. The camera: the camera's pictures are not that great even in full light, and the flash is only good for use in a flash light app.3. Apps: the Android market has a lot of apps, and the number is increasing steadily. However, there are not many QUALITY apps, like those for the iphone. Comparing social networking apps between Apple and Android and Android will lose every time, unfortunately. Android, however, does have some cool apps like navigation and 'sky', where you can see the constellations, the later is a marvelous app, but the novelty wears off quite quickly and you forget all about it.I love this phone! I am sure everyone here wants reviews that compare the N1 to the iPhone 4, however, I only have my previous Nokia N97 to compare it to in its usability. The N1 kicks ass and Nokia will never see a dime from me after their eight months of hell and terrible customer service. Thank you HTC and Google!!!! &lt;3  &lt;3 &lt;3
