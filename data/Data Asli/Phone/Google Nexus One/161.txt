I have been onto smartphones for a long time now, lately using Nokia N97, Nokia N95 before that (N73... on and on).The Nexus One is not only far better than my Nokia N97, it is IMHO opinion better than any other phone I have tried.I use it on T-Mobile. Install was as simple as popping my SIM card in and it started to work right away. Learning how to use the on screen querty keyboard took a coulple of days to get a decent accuracy.If you are a google user then you will absolutely love this phone. Before I bought the phone I was already a frequent user of Google Docs, GMail, GoogleMaps and Google Calendar. These all integrated seamlesly into my phone. The great thing is that I can do a lot of the editing on my computer too and it nicely updates on my phone. I have also started to use Google Voice and Google Listen.Setting up Pop e-mails is also easy and the application works very well.Installing apps onto the phone is a breeze. I have taken advantage of free applications for FTP, Banking, Barcode Reading, Compass, Facebook, Google Skymap, KeyRing, GPSTracking, Nimbuzz, Youtube...Wifi works great, bluetooth headset works great. GPS works. This phone does it all.The phone is very thin but it has a nice substantial feel when you hold it in your hand.I have copied mp3 files onto the phone SD card and I also take advantage of the streaming applications.This phone does it all and does not seem to have any hickups.
