Finally! The price was right! (for my wallet) and I (finally) bought this phone 4 months ago. Coming from a BB Curve 8900 and wanting a better screen to browse and read mails this phone fits the bill perfectly, designed by HTC and Google resulted in a super-b device. It fits perfectly in my hand and feels the right size and weight, it actually feels sturdy with the battery on, not so much without it. At home we also have a Samsung Galaxy S which I think is too big and square-ish (4-inch).I got it with 2.2 and was able to update it to 2.3 without any issues, it gets a little hot when it is charging and it has frozen twice requiring a battery pull out. I also notice sometimes it 'tap' itself and if checking the contacts list it will sometimes call one of the numbers.Finally, the keyboard is good but I also have press the home button accidentally more than once, which is annoying. Other than that, Great phone!
