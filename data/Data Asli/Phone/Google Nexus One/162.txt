i have experienced the g1,blackberry storm, moto cliq, iphone and many many more but none have even come close 2 being as wonderful as this one except the iphone....however i hate at@t so i would never go back...plus this phone has tons of free apps, and loads extremely fast, it beats the iphone by a few secs....i have no idea why sellers r selling this phone way above $529, which is the price u pay when buying directly from google so word of a advice be smart ppl and enjoy ur terrific phone! i know i am!
