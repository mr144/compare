This phone does everything it is supposed to do and looking at the last reviews I noticed most of them say battery life is not that good. With the new 2.3 Gingerbread upgrade that the phone got some months ago this is fixed, mine can go for 2-3 days on a single charge, of course with normal usage and turning wireless & bluetooth on and off at discretion.So far I have not seen a phone that is out there that makes me feel like it is time to change it.
