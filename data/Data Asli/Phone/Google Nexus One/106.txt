Nexus one is still a very good smartphone after a year and a half since it was released. After seeing the Nexus S I have decided to save some money and get the Nexus one.One caveat: I bought the phone from The OEM Planet and I was not able to get Google's OTA update (the version I got with the phone was 2.2 when there 2.3.4 was already out). After searching a bit in forums and blogs I found out that the version installed on the phone I got was a Vodafone tailored one. I used the instructions on [...] to manually update to the Google official version and from there I got the OTA update.
