This was a really nice phone and my first smart phone.  However the one problem I had was that a few days after the warranty from Amazon was up, the power button stopped working.  I had to download an app to get the phone to wake up.  Very annoying.  I upgraded to a Nexus S instead.  A much bigger phone but it works.
