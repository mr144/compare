Before Android 2.2 (FroYo) was released, I felt nervous about having purchased this phone, since the iPhone 4 looked so shiny and nice. FroYo has stabilized the device and now it runs very fast. The Portable Hostpot makes a bus or carpool commute heavenly (do not drive and surf!). Only sad that there will be no Nexus Two.
