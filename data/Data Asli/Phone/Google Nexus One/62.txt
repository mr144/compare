First off this is my first smart phone. I did not want to spend a lot of money. Ordinarily I would not spend more then $60 for a phone. However I got to play with some Android phones and did some research and was hooked(gotta have one). I do not have a contract so i just use my existing ATT sim that i have had for years. I knew the risks associated with the phone. I did not need the ATT 3g because, it does not even work in my area. And even where it does, I am not the typical power user. I would rather use WiFi for the most part. I really wanted the Galaxy S2, but can not afford that one. So I went with this one. For the price point $260, you can not find a phone like this brand new, unlocked, GSM ready, the specs, etc. Got mine with 2day shipping. Turned it on. Updated to Gingerbread and was good to go. There are some cons like the screen size is smaller then i would like. Sun light glare can be a pain. The speakers are weak. And the battery only last about 12-16hrs with minimal use. In the past I used phones with far longer life, but take into account that this is basically like having a little computer in your pocket all day. So would I recommend? Yes I would. If you are looking for something sleeker, sexier and newer. keep looking.
