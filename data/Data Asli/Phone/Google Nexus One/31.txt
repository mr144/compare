The HTC Nexus one is one of the best Android phones. However, never buy any items from Firemall. I purchased this item from 'Firemall' which is not a reliable, trust worthy vendor. If you have any issues, they will ask to return the item for exchange, after receiving the item they will stop responding. No phone number will be provided either. You will be cheated just like that. Sincere advice, stay away from Firemall!
