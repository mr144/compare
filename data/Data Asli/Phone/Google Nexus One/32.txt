Got it from Amazon from a third party (FGS Trading) claiming it had warranty. After about 8 months the power button and touch screen started having issues, I could not turn on my phone, and the screen was acting all crazy, not responding to commands. I searched the web and found out these are very common problems. Called HTC Repair Line, and they told me warranty had expired in December and were unable to renew it because I had purchased from a third party vendor. I thought I had full warranty on it, I did not know I only had a few months of warranty left on it. I will have to pay almost full price for repair now. Not worth the buy. Shame on HTC for charging to fix a problem they caused. BUYER BEWARE. The warranty the seller claims is not the full warranty from the sold date, it is the one from date of manufacturing.
