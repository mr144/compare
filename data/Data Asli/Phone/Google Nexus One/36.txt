I bought this phone less than a year ago. I loved it when I first got it. Solid feel, looks great. It was my first Android phone and I was so happy to jump on that bandwagon. Nexus One could do lots of things I could not do before with my Blackberry and Nokia. Unfortunately, 6 months into use with great care, the touch screen became really crazy. It will not do what I was aiming to do. Sometimes it'll just vibrate and do nothing at all. If you look online, a lot of people are having the same issue. And no one really knows if it is hardware or software. Finally after a mere 7 months, it died on me. If someone could fix my Nexus One completely, I did love to keep using it. But I will not shell out another $200 for HTC to 'fix' it...
