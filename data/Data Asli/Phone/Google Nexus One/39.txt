These phones have a 12 month warrenty from HTC.  The warrenty starts on the manufacture date NOT the purchase date.  6 months after I purchased this phone I called HTC about a problem and was told the 12 month warrenty had already expired and there was nothing they could do about this.  If you buy this phone I would immediatly call HTC and find out how much warrenty is remaining.
