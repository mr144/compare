I purchased this phone from Pavillion Electronics (Mitchel Berkowitz) fulfilled by Amazon last June 2011.Six months later the phone is not working properly - black screen after placing a call requiring to remove the battery.  I called HTC (888-216-4736) for repair and their response was:- Amazon and Pavillion Electronics are not authorized resellers for HTC- The warranty of my phone expired December 2011 - warranty is not from purchase date- Repair cost ranges from $55 to $283 and inbound (to HTC) shipping charge is at customer's expense- Repair takes 10 to 15 daysAs for the phone itself, it works pretty well except that sometimes apps that use game graphics cause menu flickering after closing the app.
