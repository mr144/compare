Easily, the biggest POS phone I have ever had. To make it worse, it was through Sprint. Ca not wait to get rid of them both. My Nexxus is less than a year old, and it can not receive texts, gives me no notifications of missed calls and voicemail, and can barely make or receive a call without cutting me off. Buy this phone and I promise you, you'll be sorry. Use Sprint if you also wanna get screwed by your cell carrier.
