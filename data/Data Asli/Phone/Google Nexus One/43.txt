After 6 months this phone started becoming non-responsive at times. While still very much under warranty I discussed with HTC resolutions to my issue. They suggested a factory reset to the item, which did not work, and that if it did not work that I could return the item after providing a proof of purchase. I faxed to them my Amazon receipt, to which they replied that because I purchased the item on Amazon they would not warranty it.HTC does not consider Amazon a legitimate market place.Amazon has worked with me on this issue and at this point has provided me with a return label and a promise that they will reimburse me with a fair amount, which I consider to be good business.***Amazon is a GREAT place to buy and you should be confident that they stand behind their products***HTC does not stand behind their products
