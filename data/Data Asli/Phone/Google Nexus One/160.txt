Great phone. Good app selection, assuming it will only get better since android seems to be the new mobile device standard. I moved to Nexus one from iPhone 3Gs. Have not really found any thing that it does not have compared to it, but it does have lot of features (Navigation, Voice apps, Camera with zoom and flash, 5MP, upgradable memory, removable battery etc.) that iPhone did not have. Voice quality is great as well.
