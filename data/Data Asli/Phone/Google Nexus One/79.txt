I live in Panama, received the phone well packaged, open it, insert a sim card and it works immediately.  I was prepared to apply at least 5 or 7 steps of the 20 I read on other reviews for the downgrade and posterior update of the software, but (and thanks God)the phone ask, once you are connected (which did with no trouble) that there available updates,you press yes and then, after a few minutes, it was upgraded to 2.3.4 gingerbread.
