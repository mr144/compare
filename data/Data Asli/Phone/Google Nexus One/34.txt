I owned this phone for nine months.Hardware:  By far its most outstanding feature is the crisp 480x800 display.  Everything else - wifi, speakerphone, camera, etc. is adequate.  The phone is sleek and comfortable to use.  Wifi and GPS are huge drains on battery.  It is best to have them turned off unless specifically needed.Software:  On startup, access point information for mobile networking was missing from the config.  I had to add it for my carrier (under Settings -> Wireless and Networks -> Mobile Networks -> Access Point Names).  Since I did not buy the phone from my carrier there was no extra bloatware on it - just the basic Android operating system.An OTA upgrade from Android version 2.2 to 2.3 broke the dictionary suggestions feature when typing.  (see issue #18716 on the Android issue tracking system at code.google.com.  This is supposed to have been fixed with version 2.3.6.)  I had to install a third-party keyboard to work around the problem.Reliability:  The phone started exhibiting problems after nine months.  First, the camera stopped working.  Next, the screen would go blank after a call started and remain unresponsive.  Could not access any of the on-screen controls for ending and muting calls or switching to speakerphone.  I did have to press down on the bottom of the battery compartment to get the screen to display, or remove the battery and do a hard reset.  I have seen many people report similar problems after a few months of usage.  Like others, I received a very poor response from HTC and a refusal for warranty service.  Amazon, on the other hand, offered to refund the original amount.  Kudos to them for doing so.Bottom line: This phone is good when it functions.  Unfortunately, a number of people have had problems with it and the manufacturer is unwilling to fulfill its warranty obligations.
