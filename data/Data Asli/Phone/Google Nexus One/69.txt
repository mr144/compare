a great phone at a very cheap price. launched in 2010, the phone got the 2.3.4 OTA update and still beats 2011 new phones. application/games all loads w/o any problemsNexus one in general is prone to wifi issues. wifi shuts off during display off (root level bug in nexus one and google does not have a fix)unfortunately I did not notice it soon enough and unable to return it now.Google 'nexus one + wifi issues' to learn more.so if you are user who has voip application and only depend on wifi, then this phone is NOT recommended
