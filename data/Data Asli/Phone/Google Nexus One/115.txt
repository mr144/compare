The nexus one phone is not bad, but not as good as I expected.Good side:1) seamless integration with android system.I used a few other android products, they all have small problems.The most common is bad wiki connection. However, this one has the bestintegration. No surprise, it is from Google, the father of Android.2) tons of apps and customizations. Even better than iphone.If you are looking for smart phone, this one and iphone are the answers.Bad side:1) Battery life is too short. Even if you do not use the phone,the android background process still runs and drain out the batteryvery soon. Basically I have to charge the phone every day, or twice a day.That is a pain.2) Too many buttons. Almost no manual. I have to figure out everything myself.It is ok for me since I am a smartphone guy, but not ok for grandma and grandpa.I think they can easily remove at least half of the buttons.Cautious:The price of the phone changes greatly! You can see a 20% price change within a week!That is what happens to me. So watch the price and try to catch a good deal.I would expect the price of android products drops significantly in 2011 and 2012.Good words for the seller:I got the phone, but only after 1 week, the price drop 20%. You can imagine I am so mad.The seller will not refund you as the competition is severe in amazon. But the seller is sokind that we finally work out something different. I can not complain too much now.I think the customer need to be very cautious with the price change and make your own smart move.
