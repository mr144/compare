This is one of the best phone I have ever used.  It's fast, stable, and fully customizable.  It works wonderfully with T-mobile 3g web2go data plan for $10.  I love Amazon!!  They give away a free app a day!After a year of usage, the phone begin to have issues.  My wife and two other friends have this phone and all of us have the same problem with the screen.  Sometimes, the screen does not register your touch (especially when the phone gets hot) or register the wrong button.  A reboot usually solves the problem, but it always come back.
