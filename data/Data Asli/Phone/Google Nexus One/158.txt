I must admit that I may not be the authority on smart phones, I came from using a five year old Motorola Razor. I do however love Google applications, Mail, Calender, Voice. This phone is amazing. I am so happy even with the large price tag (unlocked). I bought this phone without the intention of getting a data plan because I do not need to browse while I drive, and the GPS while cool, is not important to me. I use Wifi at home, work, and school. The Wifi allows me to do everything a data plan would do. Apps are good enough for me, and seem to be increasing. Call quality is better than my land line, impressive. The only small things I have noticed is the speaker is on the back and if it is resting on something the sound is muffled making calls on speaker difficult (absolutely not a deal-breaker). The Speech-to-text is awesome, pretty accurate if you can annunciate and speak clearly, I use it all the time. Anything people say about multi-touch is a weak argument, the features to zoom etc.. are great. Amazing phone, I have been watching all the iPhone commercials to see if my phone can do that too, and it can. Thanks Google.
