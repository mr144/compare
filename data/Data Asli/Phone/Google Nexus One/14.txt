I love this product at first ...Fast track and delivery...however...It's auto config is a little bit different from the one my friends have ,because sometimes it seems to loose its configuration...And no one who has this issue ,but ,out of nowhere ,the cellphone starts turning the screenlight on and off. I hate when this happens,specially at night and I have already tried everything to fix it .closing apps ,recharging,turning on and off ,and it keeps &#34;blinking&#34;but no big deal,I put it under my pillow ,so I do not have to see it
