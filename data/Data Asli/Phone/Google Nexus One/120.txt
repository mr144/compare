I purchased the Nexus One on release day from Google, and almost a year and a half later, it is simply the best phone that I could have asked for.  Since it is a Google phone, it receives all of the Android updates first while other Android smartphones sold from the cell providers are slowly (if even) receiving theirs.  Moreover, this phone is the most solid-feeling phone I have ever felt.  It's much sturdier than many of the other smart phones such as the Droid which feels as if it can be easily damaged (in my opinion).  Also, it is EXTREMELY thin for smartphones which is a plus for me since I hate having huge phones stick out of my front pocket.If you are looking for a simple, easy to use device without all of the gimmicks of other smartphones, get it.  You will not regret it.P.S. - The neoprene case that it comes with is completely awesome.  I have had so many people ask where I got it from.  I wish that there was some place which sold these because they would be selling like hotcakes!
