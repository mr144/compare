Fast, great connection, excellent call quality, super fast, Google - Gmail flawless integration, customizable settings, touch screen works perfectly, great variety of apps (must of them free), and finally, nice size and shape.As a former Iphone user I can say that this is a much more reliable phone.  It's a shame that Google failed with its marketing campaign and sales model for such a wonderful product. This is where Apple has the advantage.JH
