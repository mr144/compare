Overall nice model. It hangs once a day or so, I am not sure if it is the phone or the apps which cause issues. It it is reliable, I would have been happy. Also malware threats are disturbing.Unlocked which is great, I have used consistently in USA and India, very good coverage/reception.Navigation: Unbelievably great app, Google navigation, no one can beat. But, Nexus one gets extremely hot after using GPS for an hour or so. Even iphone gets hot, but may not be as much.Music: Google music is a savior. l crippled after using 32 Gigs on iphone 3GS. 32 Gig microSD cards still cost around $100.Camera : not goodStreaming audio goodTethering: excellent, but ATT is a pain and has plenty of issues.
