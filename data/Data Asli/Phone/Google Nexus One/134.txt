Have G1 and happy with it. Purchased Nexus One and only had problems. Very disappointing. After a few days phone started to reboot sporadically. At first, while being charged. It would shut down and come back up. Now it just shuts down and then gets stuck on during initial sequence, showing the X-logo. Soft reboot (power+volume+trackball) does not help and have to hard boot it (by removing battery) few times a day.  Can not return it, since two weeks had passed. HTC has a warranty and will replace it, but customer service rep. said they get A LOT of calls like that with the same problem. It did sound like HTC has a hardware issue with this phone. Buyers beware. After that experience would drop Tmobile/Nexus one in a heartbeat for iPhone but ATT pulled a plug on unlimited data plan, sigh. This phone is the best.
