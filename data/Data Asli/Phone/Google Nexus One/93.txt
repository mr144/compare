This is my first review on Amazon, because other purchases before are pretty good to me.And it is just a reminder to someone interested in this product, maybe not each one looks like this.I do not have this brand of cell phone before, so I am not sure if it is true. First, it came without plastic seal'and had some black or gray trace on the out packing both front and back(not the AMAZON delivery package but the cell box). Second, I notice the version of Android is 2.2 but with the app2sd application, which I believe is not belong to the original android system. Also it can not update to 2.3.4 through OTA, just said something like your system is up to the latest version while 2.3.4 came out like a month ago...Later, I tried so hard to manually update the system to 2.3.4(after I refresh the 2.2 Rom from Google mirror image) and some applications like Amazon mp3 finally showed up.So whether it is not brand new or just not the US version, I do not know which one is the truth.Besides that everything seems fine, so I decide to keep it until some other problems showed up.Update: call HTC with IMEI, Canadian version confirmed.Update on 06/30/2011: call HTC for warranty.Since it is a Canadian version, no US warranty from HTC. If something happened, should contact Canadian distributors.Tragedy ...I also want to know the seller claimed US warranty, where it came from...
