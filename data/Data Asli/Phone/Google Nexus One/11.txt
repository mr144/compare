When working, this is a very good phone. Unfortunately, my Google Nexus phone seems to work and then need repairs. Even without problems, it takes about a minute to power on. The problem is that every few months, the phone will not power on. For the 4th time in 3 years this has occured. This time I refuse to pay to get it reapired. RIP, Google Nexus.
