I have owned my Nexus One for 5 months now, pretty much since it came out. I had mixed feelings about it initially, mostly due to the complicated workarounds that were necessary to get its calender to sync with an Exchange server, and the 3G issues that were widespread initially. But I decided to put up with its shortcomings, because I saw there was upside potential.I recently upgraded to Android 2.2 Froyo, which finally made the Nexus One the best phone it can be. The performance and UI responsiveness that was already good is now even better, many many basic software issues were resolved, including tethering, better Exchange support, an improved email client, a redesigned car app, and much more. I love this phone and my next phone will also be an Android phone. I hope I will not need a next phone for many years, though. And yes, there are still some minor things that can be improved, like better readability in direct sunlight, or better battery life. Based on what is technically possible today and what the market has to offer in terms of alternatives, I recommend this phone unconditionally.
