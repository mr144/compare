I have had this phone for almost 1 1/2 years (purchased during launch week).  The only issues I have had came after the Gingerbread update (2.3.4).  I did a hard reset, and things went back to normal.  This led me to believe it was a compatibility issue with one of the installed apps.This review is in response to a posting in the past week that rated the phone 1 out of 5.  The main complaint was that the phone did not do international SMS.  I have sent and received thousands of international texts (SMS and MMS) with the phone (to and from Asia and Canada originating and ending in Missouri).  I hope that this review helps put people's worries to rest about this claim.  The author of the mentioned review also refers to the phone as the G1.  The 'G1' is not the Nexus One; it is an early android phone also made by HTC that predates the Nexus One by about a year.  He may have been reviewing the wrong phone.
