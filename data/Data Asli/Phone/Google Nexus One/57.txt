I bought this phone on the google website when it first came out, My contract ended already and i had the chance to get a new phone, but even though this phone is a yr old it can still compete with current phones. Not to mention is is VERY sturdy, i was running across the street to catch my bus and the phone fell off my pocket!!! it landed in the middle of the street!the battery fell out and i thought for sure my phone was a goner!! But sure enough the screen? no scratches! the phone? as if i never dropped it! only thing it had from the fall was a small scratch on one of the corners. :D It is also a great phone to hack, (mine is modded, It also allows the use wifi tethering FREE!! it never shows up in my bill :D but thats cuz it was hacked :D) If u hack make sure to give it to someone who knows what they are doing. Over all the best phone ive ever had, oh and do not get the Nexus S, its not the same one, the nexus One is made by htc, nexus S is made by samsung.
