I bought the phone around 2 months ago, so I can give valuable comments on it. The phone is not working. First, the camera does not work. then it is the battery, now the phone can not even hold on for 10 hours with the full battery... and reception ... I do not know what to say, it was a big mistake to buy the phone over the internet, because if you have a problem they do not even try to help you. Please do not make the mistake I did except you think you have better luck!
