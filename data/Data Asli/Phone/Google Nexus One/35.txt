I purchased Google Nexus One Unlocked Phone with Android--U.S. Warranty (Brown) on 19March2012.  Contacted HTC when I noticed that box was open, and charger was not for the U.S. and that someone had added an adapter for U.S.  HTC informed me that my IMEI number matched a U.K. phone, and that any U.S. warranty expired 11April2012.  Contacted UnlockedCellPhoneKings and was told that 'We have a 90 day warranty covering any manufacturer defects or problems with the device.  The listing never advertised a 1 year manufacturer warranty.  Amazon actually creates the listings themselves so they are fully aware of it. Everything is posted accurately.'  This is certainly not the expectation of any reasonable person who purchases a 'new' electronic device.  They did offer to refund, but this is a token gesture to placate an angry individual that has been scammed.  Shame on Amazon and shame on UnlockedCellPhoneKings.  It seems Amazon has joined the race to the bottom and will soon exceed the expectations of users of EBay and Craiglist that they will be cheated.
