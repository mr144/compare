I purchased this phone directly from Google last year.Pros:1. Android is great and being and google developer phone you get the new release directly from Google.2. Most of your data is stored in the cloud (except for sms and some other data), so when you decide to update to another android phone all you need to do is login and you data will be restored to the new phone.3. Fantastic apps like maps, navigation, google goggles, gmail, gvoice...4. Battery life has improved with the 2.3.4 update which is the current version as of this date.etc... I can go on and on about the pros, but many reviews have already covered them.Cons:1. If you are like me and do not use a protective cover around your phone, dust can easily get inside.2. You need to press slightly above the 4 buttons for the touch to register.3. When the phone gets hot (from using navigation for a while), the touch screen wont register your impressions correctly. The easy fix is to turn the screen off and on by pressing the lock button twice.4. The camera zoom spring is noisy and makes a sound if you shake the phone hard.Main issues resolved with android updates1. Battery life was a problem, but the battery life has been great with 2.3.4 release.2. Sometimes it does not automatically connect to your saved wifi. You will have to manually connect.Overall a great phone.One advise I have for people who travel a lot is the store their contacts numbers starting with + along with the international code. It makes life a lot easier when you travel and use a local sim.
