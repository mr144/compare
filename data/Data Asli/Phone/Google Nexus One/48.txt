This phone was a great purchase. I use the phone with AT&T Go phone, Google Voice, and Groovie IP. I work from home, so most of the time I make calls through the internet. With this setup I am only paying less than $20 a month with a data plan and taxes included. I have not found a better plan out there. It is great for watching movies with Netflix and Hulu. It works great with Google music and Pandora. I use Google Reader to read all my news. The thing fits perfectly in my pocket to take anywhere. It also replaces my TomTom for driving directions, because it is always up to date and gives me the current traffic. It works as my GPS for running with the Run keeper app.Before a year of use. The power button on went out on the phone. I would not recommend anyone to buy this phone any longer, because there has been many people with the same power button problem. I have gotten around the power button with installing cyanogenmod 7 on the phone with ROM Manager. With this I can wake the phone with with track ball. The phone is still useful but not reliable, because if the phone freezes up or dies one can not power back on the phone without a power cord plugged into it. Also, I have stopped using Groovie IP with the phone I now use talk-a-tone.
