I got this phone as a gift 5 months ago.  It's my first 'smart phone'.I waited forever for this phone to be released.  I have not been disappointed!!This phone has been nothing but awesome for me.  I am extremely demanding withmy electronics.  I expect them to do everything without problems.  The apps inthe Android Marketplace are nothing short of incredible!!  My phone is capableof doing things never before imagined.  Now with the release of Android 2.2 it isnow possible to use the phone as a wi-fi hotspot for up to 5 devices, view webpages with FLASH content and browse the internet even faster.  The build qualityis superior.  Battery life is VERY good.  The phone is super fast. It does everythingyou would want a phone to do and even more.  My only complaint is that self-portraitsare difficult at best.  Definitely the best phone on the market, except for the new EVOfrom HTC on Sprint.  This phone is only usable on T-Mobile and AT&T.
