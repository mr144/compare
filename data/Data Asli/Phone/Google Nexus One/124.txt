Google Nexus One is by far one of the best mobiles the world has ever seen.Quality used for the phone is just fantastic, looks and feels very premium. OTA updatein google is just a bliss which you cannot find in any other google phoneswhere you have to take the phone to the service centre or to your operator to update the same.i have recently updated OTA update to Froyo 2.2.2 FRG83 and im quite confident that 2.3 gingerbread updateis just round the corner, users can sit back and relax getting the update without any need to panic or togo to the operators and service centres for the same.i had purchased the phone from Unlocked fones, My Experience with Unlocked Fones was for the first time and i would rate the company to be EXCELLENT++ and i would strongly recommend anyone and everyone to buy fones from them. Not only they are prompt in their deliveries but their customer service is also very courteous and the BEST any customer could find. im totally satisfied with the product and the customer service.I have practically used almost all the phones in the market,Android OS especially after 2.1 Eclair just rocks!!! There is just no comparisons with Symbian, Windows or Mac OSphones as Android is the way towards next generation. i have upgradedthe same to maximum 32GB micro-SD and it does not make your phone slow at all.I would rate GOOGLE NEXUS ONE to be the BEST as GOOGLE has not allowed even HTC to do their own userinterface customization like other branded fones, so its just PURE feeling of Froyo.
