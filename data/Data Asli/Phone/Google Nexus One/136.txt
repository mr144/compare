For the past five years, I have been using Blackberry phones, the latest two being the Bold, but as far as I am concerned the Nexus One I purchased from Google is my best phone experience yet.  Perfect...no, but far better than other phones I have owned.  Yes, the Blackberry has an excellent email application and is secure, but not that much better than what an Android-based phone provides.  Plus, I am not locked-in to whatever software the vendor decides to provide; or decides to install on my phone without my saying 'yes' or 'no'.Having zoom-able text is also a big plus.  I can now easily read text, web sites, etc. without squinting at too small text and images. Also, the AMOLED screen is bright and sharp.  The phone itself is clearly high quality.  Sorry that Google decided to 'bag' their on-line store due to marketplace realities, but the phone is still available from on-line retailers (Amazon).The 1GHz processor and excellent browser options make browsing a real pleasure.  This is something that hopefully Blackberry can begin to address with their OS6.Cons: The Li-ion batter has a tendency to get hot when using too many apps and while charging, but that issue can be managed.  Also, this new generation of smartphone can really gobble the power. It requires a new set of user skills to skimp on the apps between charging sessions.While the App Market is pretty-well stocked with free and low cost applications, most of them (IMHO), are not worth all that much. So far, 70,000 are claimed, but only a very few show high quality utility or programming skills.  But, there are enough to make it interesting, ... and it can only get better. Since the N1 came out, there have been some excellent Android smartphones released to the market. You will not go wrong in my view.
