Got my Nexus one last week. pretty late in buying, but got it for 260$ so felt was a good deal for an unlocked smart phone.Problem1# When I switched my fone on for the first time, it straightaway asks me for my google account user name/password. I looked up online for nexus one's manual(I was surprised that the package did not have one), and it said 'You must enter your good username/pass to continue' or something to that sort. I did not have a data plan with AT&T before so I was worried it wud use up a lot of data. I wanted to get it connected thru Wi-fi, but this is the only screen I see when I turn on the fone. I thought it might use a few kb to verify username/pass. I log in and immediately get in and turn off data.Next day I get email from ATT for high data usage. This horrible thing downloaded 9.5MB data on my line. ATT promptly added 95$ for pay-per-use-data. Worse, they added a data plan onto me for using a smart phone.I am so much angry at google for making a fone that1. instantly on turning on, asks to connect to web (with no warning on how much data it needs)2. downloads 9.5MB!! on the first connect. What were the makers thinking!!Now I am left with a burning 95$ to pay and 25$ data plan to pay for each month, to avoid which, I bought an unlocked fone in the first place.SUCKS!!!
