This phone's power button is connected to its main board using a flexible connector. Throughout your use of the power button, this flexible connector gets bent, and progressively the contacts of the power button begin to deteriorate. In a short while, the power button will stop working.There are several workarounds for this problem: apps that replace the power button's function using other buttons, screen lock apps, reboot, and so on. There is even a routine that you have to use to power on the phone using the charger and removing/inserting the battery quickly. Google 'Nexus one fix broken power button'and you'll see more about the problem and the workarounds, including video instructions.Many thanks for the guys out there that created those workarounds, but HTC deserves a thumbs down: this design flaw really kills the phone.
