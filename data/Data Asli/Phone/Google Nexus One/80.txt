After reading all the positive reviews about this phone I decided to buy it on amazon. Right from day one it had problem being turned on. Used it for a week and then while browsing it got switched off and did not turn on again. Had to return it for refund. Also the touch screen is not very responsive, had to tap couple of times to open an app. Very unhappy with the quality of the product.
