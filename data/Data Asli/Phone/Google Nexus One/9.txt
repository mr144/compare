This phone is absolute rubbish!It goes off at random, suddenly gets hot even when you are not making a call. You cannot transfer contacts easily from your old phone and the list of woes continue. I am disappointed that Amazon decided to stake it is reputation on fulfilling this order.I wasted the $215 I spend on this phone and I am now looking to buy a new phone.There's a reason it does not have a warranty. I would not give a warranty on this either. I am learning the hard way now. In short, I am more than  disappointed  with this phone. Spare yourself the headache and do not buy it!
