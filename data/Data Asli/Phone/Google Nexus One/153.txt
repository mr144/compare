I will not do the 'technical' review since so many others do it much better than I ever could. I am just a technophile who appreciates a good phone, and not willing to go to AT&T and pay a hundred plus bucks a month for an iPhone. Other touchscreen phones left me cold, and the blackberry? Not so much.The Goolgle Nexus by far is THE best all around smart phone I have ever used. Some have described it as a computer in your pocket and I heartily concur. This IS a computer in your pocket. The browser is really fast and really easy to use, and the app store, while not as prodigious as the apple version, ai not that shabby either.Just suffice it to say, this phone really rocks my socks. For the first time ever, I am gonna say People?BELIEVE the Hype!!!! This phone is ALL that!
