I am returning this item.Out of the box, fully charged unit powers down abruptly and frequently and will not restart. I tried two factory resets to no avail. Seems like a nice phone, but it is clearly defective. Additionally, the box was missing advertised wired headset, USB cable, and pouch. I have never returned anything before, but this is just too big a rip-off.
