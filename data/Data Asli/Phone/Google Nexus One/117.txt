Been using the phone for just about 3 days and so far so good.  LOVE it.  It has everything you could want in a phone.  Small size hundred of android apps for free and ease of use.  My previous phone was the Nokia n900, which I loved.  I recently set up my google voice account and needed a reliable android phone to fully utilize google voice.  This phone does that and so much more.  For the price of this unlocked phone you can not go wrong.
