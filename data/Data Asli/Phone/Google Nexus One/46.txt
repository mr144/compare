I recently purchased this phone from a buyer off of Amazon. Got the phone, loved it but then the power button broke 3 weeks later. I paid almost 250 dollars for it and it broke within 3 weeks. I would not recommend buying this phone used unless it is in mint condition. This phone, especially its power button, are known to break very easily. If the phone did not have such a short life, it would be a perfect phone.
