I am glad that Google came out with this phone. I bought/ordered this phone on very first day of its release and this sleek phone was in my hand next day morning. First phone to jump to 1Ghz processor, high resolution screen, dual microphone with noise canceling features, led flash, stylish looks and stylish accessories with latest Android OS version 2.1and at same time first phone to have FROYO (Android 2.2) officially.This phone did set standards for many to match including iPhone.As a developer, I am so glad to have this phone as this is the only hardware that I can use to test Android 2.2 applications.I would love to see Google come out with another phone. For me Nexus One was much worth price.
