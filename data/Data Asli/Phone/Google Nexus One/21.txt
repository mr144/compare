I purchased this phone which was supposed to have 1 full year US warranty. But it turned out no warranty which was confirmed by HTC who is the manufacturer. I was cheated on this order. I spent one whole evening to communicate with the CSR and his supervisor. The 'best' solution Amazon can offer is $10 promotion credit. It is really really unfair!
