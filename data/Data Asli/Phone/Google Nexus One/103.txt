I purchased and received the G1(Google Nexus One) last Thursday. It's the good phone with all the stuffs built in (Wifi, Gmail, etc..), however, the phone has the issue of sending & receiving International SM message. I have attempted to send several messages to my friends in Vietnam, but none of messages reached them.In facts, I am not aware of the issue till start reading all complains from previous G1 users. I heard that Google have tried to fix the problem but they gave up. It is the good phone and I like to keep, however, I am in process of returning the phone today and looking for anothet phone (not Google phone any more). Someone said, that coud be T-mobile network that I have now, however, my Nokia E-71 is sending & receiving SMS message just fine.
