This is a good phone. For the price, it may well be the best smartphone available. And unlike an iPhone, you do not have to pay extra for tethering or for GPS navigation.What's the catch? Well, it comes pre-loaded with a custom build of the older Android 2.2 release. The custom build prevents easy upgrades, and without upgrades, you are stuck with a mediocre battery life and a sub-optimal user experience.My suggestion would be to look at the upgrade process (other reviews have given the details), and to buy this phone only if you have the inclination/time to go through it.upgrade hints for those who decide to take the plunge:1) search for the specific custom build number (menu-> setting->about phone) and download the correct PGIMG.zip file.2) search for 'goodbye vodaphone uk nexus one rom' and follow the instructions.
