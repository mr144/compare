I have had this lovely smartphone for nearly a year but a few weeks ago it started to fail.First the power button failed so I had to press it for several times until it turned on.Yesterday suddenly the phone died and the power button never worked again. I tried all the possible ways I found on blogs but nothing worked. So now I have a lovely expensive brick which I know its great (when it works)but saddly does not turn on!! I read this is a very common failure in this HTC Model (broken power button).
