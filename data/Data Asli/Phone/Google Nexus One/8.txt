this phone freezes when using the camera or adding pictures to a message.also the power/unlock button gets unresponsive; sometimes i have to press it 3-4 times when unlocking teh screen.I have been sold a lemon. I have bought other used/refurbished phones in the past and they have worked like new. this phone does not compare, my experience is awfull. I will never by form this seller ever again!
