I purchased this phone as a suitable alternative to the iPhone since it was unlocked and I had to travel world wide.  The reviews were mixed and technically the phone is not as good as the older iPhone 3GS but it did not cost $600 and came with a 1yr warranty so I was estatic!  Hold it- not so fast.  The 2 phones I purchased lasted less than 2 months and when I tried to send it for warranty HTC said that this was sold by some company in Canada.  I called the company and tried to return it to find out you cannot send a phone to a company in Canada because of the duties and taxes if you do not have a Canada return address.  I called AMAZON and they were less than helpful and said it is past the 30 day return period and offered to assess the phone for a partial refund.  Who knows I still have not seen it.  AMAZON says there is a disclaimer on the site that you must contact the seller and/or manufacturer for warranty information but you do not have a serial number so once again good luck and beware.  ADVISE AGAInST BUYING any cell phone from AMAZON. I think it is worse than Motorola, nokia or HTC.
