I bought this phone 2 weeks ago & now using it for more than 10 days, I will say this is the Value for Money ! for 270 $ the features specially processor speed (1GH) is too good.I got it with the Android 2.2 version & Later I updated it to 2.3.4 Ginger bread, it rocks,the speed is amazing now, I have read lot about it is wifi connectivity issue but I never faced the issue unless wifi signals are weak.Android Market is too good & most of the applications available are for free.UI is also very good & screen resolution is the best in this category !!Track ball also gives a good feel for those who have been using Blackberry.In nutshell it is a Value for money product.
