Be extremely careful when purchasing this product !!!First of all, most likely the product you'll get this late in the game comes from the other markets (Europe, Far East).In case that anything goes wrong with the device, HTC will not honor the manufacturer's warranty. Even though the phoneis technically identical, they use it as a lame excuse to not honor the warranty.Secondly, by the time something happens with your device, the seller will be long gone out of business.Thirdly (and most shamefully), amazon.com behaves much like that do not know anything about anything, they will act indolentlyin your attempt to rectify the issue.Forget about the whole deal - that's my honest advice.
