Beware of this shop.  They have a misleading title for the product as it does not include real warranty.My HTC Google Nexus One touch screen started to function really bad when kept open (you would touch one letter on the virtual keyboard and get another one instead as if selected).I contacted Pavilion Electronics but they did not honor their so called 'WARRANTY' as appears on the product name.Bottom line - do not buy from this shop.
