The phone arrived in what appeared to be the original packaging.Cons:There are issues with the capacitive buttons: you have to touch a little bit higher than expected and that can sometimes get in the way of hitting buttons or items in the lower part of the screen. The phone comes with a trackball which could lead to issues down the road with it becoming 'gunked up.'Pros:-The phone runs the latest version of Android (Gingerbread) after following the downgrade instructions found under the steps found after googling 'Goodbye Vodafone.'-The phone is very snappy. The only downside to the performance is that there are now dual-core phones, and phones with newer processors and much more powerful graphics chips.-The phone is unlocked and runs 3G on T-Mobile (EDGE for AT&T). For $70 you get unlimited class, texts, and data on T-Mobile. The phone can be used with any GSM carrier worldwide.The truth is that when you look at a Nexus One for about $270 versus any other off contract phone at T-Mobile the Nexus One wins hands down!I am very happy with this purchase!!!
