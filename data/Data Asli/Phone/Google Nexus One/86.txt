Echo all the comments on the awesomeness of this phone.  The device 'gets out of the way' of your use of it, everything from apps to bluetooth to messaging to calling, it is all easy and intuitive.  Graphics are great with minimum lag.  It updated itself to Gingerbread (2.3.4) within an hour over WiFi.How I wish it all worked out.  After a few hours, a serious touch screen issue developed.  Touching anywhere in the lower half of the screen (around the virtual keyboard area) would register the touch a few centimeters below it.  For example, pressing the 's' key would bring up the voice input or even the menu soft key.  Even after pulling the battery and factory resets, the problem would always recur, making the phone almost impossible to use.This is the second Nexus One I have owned that had this problem.  I was hoping the first one was a dud, especially with all the praise from long-time owners, but it started right away with the second.  Just do a web search on 'nexus one touchscreen problem' and you'll see discussions and video of it, unfortunately without a resolution I could find.If you buy this otherwise great phone, hope you get a good one.
