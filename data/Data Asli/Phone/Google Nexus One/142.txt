In spite of a hard case and screen protector (neither of which were even scratched) the LED screen broke underneath.  So now I have to pay another $[...](deductible on insurance) and use a loaner phone while the insurance company orders a new phone for me.  I still give my N1 five stars - I like it that much.  But now, I am buying a Tough Case from case-[...] (hybrid two layer case with gel inside and hard outside) and an invisible shield from [...] to protect it.  I suggest everyone does.
