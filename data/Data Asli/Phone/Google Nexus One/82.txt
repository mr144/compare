PROS:* Outstanding call quality* Great looking screen* Speedy performance* Still camera is above average for a phone* Included accessories are not garbageCONS:* Excessive heat generated during normal use* Battery cover can be difficult to remove* Phone is very fragile, especially the screen* Very quiet ringer and alarm, even at highest volumeCALL QUALITY: 10/10Call quality is superlative.SCREEN: 7/10Brightness, color reproduction, resolution and pixel density are all good.  The screen itself feels extremely fragile, however, and I would not feel safe without a screen protector on it.CPU/GPU AND WIFI PERFORMANCE: 8/10The CPU and GPU handle nearly everything with aplomb.  Wifi reception improves with Gingerbread, but range is still limited.CAMERA: 8/10I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the images the Nexus One produces, particularly outdoors without a flash.EXTRAS: 10/10The wired headset included with the Nexus One is above average when used for voice calls.BATTERY: 5/10Upgrading to Gingerbread will reduce power consumption for most tasks, but even then battery life is only average compared to similar devices.  Battery temperature sometimes exceeds 45C (113F).BUILD QUALITY, DURABILITY AND APPEARANCE:  2/10It requires a LOT of pressure to release the battery cover, and I can feel the screen buckling under my fingers every time.  The Nexus One is very fragile but overall looks good.  The silver paint started coming off after one week of gentle use, and it malfunctions with high-heat activities (e.g. GPS and 3G internet).  Add at least $30 to the cost to buy quality screen and body protectors.EXTERNAL SOUND AND AUDIO: 2/10The external speaker is just terrible.  Even at full volume, it is mostly a garbled mess of quiet sound.CONCLUSION:  6/10The Nexus One performs most tasks well but will not last long if you are not especially careful with it.
