I bought my first smart phone ever, the N1, barely few weeks back and i am highly impressed. So far, i am loving it not because i am new to it, but because its impressed me with its versatile ability to multi-task as well as the solid hardware. Rather unfortunate it has been discontinued. I am glad i have one of the last of them and i rate this phone as the best of all time. I am not new to touch screen; i have played with a few phones of my friends and i think this is simply the best. It was delivered before 5days before hand--wonderful service
