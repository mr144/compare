I purchased the cell phone after long time of reading about and viewing others comment and then I bought that cell phone; however someimportant notes has to be considered by any prospective buyer:1- the phone does not support the Arabic language while it support so many other language. Even though if you choose UNICODE for browsing, the texts will still messed.2- the cell phone came without CD or any user manual, I downloaded the software from HTC web site. My PC could not recognize the cell phone after all needed guidance.3- the touch screen sometimes does not respond as expected.I read in interenet somemony articles about how to make the cell phone recognizable and ...etc.Finally I came up with the conclusion to return the product to seller.I might be unlucky with that cell phone as many are.
