LOVE my Nexus one! I bought mine from Google when I was able to get it inscribed, and I like that.  You'll love all the customizing options, the bright screen display, the google maps and navigation, and the ease of use.  I do not even have a 3G plan with T-mobile, I just use the Wifi wherever I can pick it up.  My husband has this phone too, and he has 3G.  This phone allows you to tether, so he turns that on, and I pick up Wifi from his tether!  Save ourselves 30 bucks a month from buying 3G.  Now I know you are saying, Are you and your husband really together all the time? No, but when we are it is convenient, and there are lots of places out there with free Wifi, or just even where I can log on, like my own house, my parent's or a friend's house.
