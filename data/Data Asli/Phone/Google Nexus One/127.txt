Very good finish, flawless startup process and very user friendly. The armdroid platform appears to be very estable and the applications available are very promising.Only comment is that the hardware is provided with a charger appliance that appears to be Europe standard...On the same fashion, the startup quick guide is in Danish or some other nordic language.
