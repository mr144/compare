Stay AWAY from NEXUS ONE. Phone's power button stopped working just after around 4 months of use. I paid additional 100$ for the repair but it is not of use. It cause mental pressure, loss of contacts, time, and money.I purchased the mobile on Amazon through UnlockedCellPhoneKings who claimed that mobile is still under manufacture's warranty. But, warranty expired just after 3 months of my purchase.I give 1 rating to both Nexus One and UnlockedCellPhoneKings. Sorry, I could not give lesser than this.
