Let me start off by stating, this is my unproven opinion with zero evidence. But many will already agree..... So, even though the N1 was released about a year ago, this phone has still failed to show it is age. Many people had the chance to own the only 'true Google phone', however considering the way it was marketed, I can understand why sales were bleak. In retrospect, this turned out to be win win for the original owners, as this phone is now seen as a limited edition, and with a huge envy directed at the Nexus One. It is true many Android phones with similar specs/better have been released (And I have used many extensively), but there is only one Android phone. The Google Nexue One.
