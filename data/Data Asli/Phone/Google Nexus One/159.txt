This phone is all that and a bag of chips. Rather than go into technical detail what I would like to say is this: At no point have I felt like this phone was having its way with me. There was no sense of compromise, no software I had to leave on the main page, no program I had to go around to do what I wanted, and no feature I had to use if I did not want to. There was no accidentally hitting a button and signing up for a crappy random service (I am looking at you AT&T navigator). The software was easy to navigate through (once I realized I could pull the top screen tab down with a swipe). Going from a call, to the net, to the music player, to a picture, to a message and back is breeze.I love this phone.I experienced a few minor hiccups with apps that Google was nice enough to refund me for at the press of a button. No human intervention necessary.I love the fact there is a light up trackball on the phone that I have never used. I really do.
