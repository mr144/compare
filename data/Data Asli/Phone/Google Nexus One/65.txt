This phone came out in Jan 2010, and it is still selling well thanks to a solid design and being well-supported (mine updated to Gingerbread 2.3.4 immediately as soon I powered it on). AFter all, this is/was the 'Google Phone.'No real complaints overall, the phone's snappy and does everything I did like it to do - after several hours of research I was not able to find coherent and reliable instructions re: how to unlock the bootloader and subsequently root it (really wanted to run CM7, but got cockblocked by HTC for the moment, esp. after upgrading to 2.3.4 - much more involved to root, from what I gather) but I am adapting well to Android after abandoning my iPhone 4. Paired this with an Otterbox Commuter case for $16 making my total investment in the Android platform around two-seventy-five buckaroos - would have loved to have a Nexus S, Galaxy II, Evo, etc. but this was what my budget could handle in an unlocked service provider format for the moment. Highly recommended!
