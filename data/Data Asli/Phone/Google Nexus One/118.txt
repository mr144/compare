I have had this phone since it came out and I STILL would not trade it in for any other phone on the market!  I have gotta give a lot of credit to the developers on that though, since they have supported this phone so well.  Rooted, overclocked, undervolted Nexus One w/ CyanogenMod's latest... WINNING!
