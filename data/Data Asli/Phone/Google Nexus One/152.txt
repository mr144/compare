Slick phone but the first one I got had issues.The issues were all minor but taken as a whole, the phone was 'bad'.1. The phone was not configured properly (network settings, affecting all txt & picture messaging)2. It had touchscreen issues, freezing often along certain areas (edges) or on certain functions, or randomly selected the wrong thing on a completely different area of the touchpad.3. Unwanted apps would open. (Google voice)Eventually I called HTC. They sent a new phone and after a triple-fail delivery by FedEx and two trips by me to their warehouse, I am seriously disappointed with FedEx but happy with my new, properly working Nexus One. This phone is markedly better than the last one, it was configured out of the box, it does not freeze up when I enter a message thread, and the screen just seems more quick and responsive.A good all around phone and handheld platform, but thoroughly test the phone you purchase before your 30 day return period is up. Otherwise, you are screwed and a replacement will cost you the full $529 or whatever it is.Also, if troubleshooting, do not push the little hole on the back interior that says 'VOID' at the bottom. I thought it was a reset button but it may void your warranty as it covers a tiny screw.
