The Google Nexus One made by HTC is an excelent phone, very powerful, and I have not had problems so far. I could update it to Gingerbread (2.3.4) via OTA without any problems. The only thing you should consider in any android and any smartphone device is the battery consumption which is very high. I live in Ecuador and I can use the phone perfectly.This phone is awesome. I am  very pleased with this purchase.
