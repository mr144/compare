Bought this phone almost a year ago with US warranty version. It was working fine a few months and then started to notice the touchscreen issue. When tapping on the app or icon, the wrong app will open or navigatin softkey was selected.  Typing text has become a big issue since the wrong characters were selected. After extensive search and found out that the touchscreen issue is the major problem for the nexus one. HTC and Google did not have any solution for it since this is the hardware flaw on the touchscreen itself. Only way to remedy the situation is to turn off the screen for a second and turn on again.  The screen will recalibrated and allow the selection to be made correctly after that.  However, after a period of usage, the issue will present itself again.  If I would have known that this the main issue of the handset, I would have return it right away.  Warranty would not help either since there is no fix for this issue and it will happen on every nexus one.  Same issue also found on the Nexus S.  They should have recall the product instead of keep selling the defective unit.
