Purchased this unlocked phone, about a month ago. Took the sim card out of my very old, pay-as-you-go, T-Mobile phone and the Nexus One worked immediately. Calls are very clear. Wifi access to web is excellent. Quick and reliable. Migrated my Outlook calendar and contacts to Google apps. Easy process. Took minutes. Google Voice works fantastically, when I have a wifi connection. Very responsive touchscreen. Web access (via wifi) is good. Fairly fast. Flash support is good but far from perfect. You will definitely not get all of the Flash objects on web pages that you would otherwise be able to access on a desktop computer, but that's really an Android OS thing, and not an issue with the phone itself. Still, worth mentioning.Wish that the micro SD card was accessible without having to take the back off of the device, but not a big deal. I have not done much with the camera or video, but that's not why I purchased the phone. I have other devices forI was little worried about purchasing an unlocked phone, but have not had a single problem. Have not yet upgraded to newest Android OS. Still running Froyo, but no compatibility problems, yet.Would absolutely recommend this phone to others.
