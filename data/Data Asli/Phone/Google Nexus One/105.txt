Phone works well -- purchased from blu tek, and arrived with froyo 2.2, with no available updates.  As did others who have written detailed reviews (ie, Syed M Fahad), I had to manually install a different version.  It arrived with 'Build Number: 2.16.405.1 CL223106 release-keys', but in order to get over the air updates, I had to get it to 'Build Number: FRG33'.  Once that was successful, the OTA update for 2.3.4 arrived.  To get detailed instructions, search for 'goodbye vodafone uk nexus one rom'.  I used Upgrade Process steps 1-5, and then the OTA came automatically.
