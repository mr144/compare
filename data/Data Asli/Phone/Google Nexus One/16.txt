I had ordered this refurbished phone on 1/Dec/12 and received it yesterday (9/Dec).Overall happy as i received the product in good condition and the phone appears brand new. The product came in a custom box with phone and accessories (usb cable [brand name : phihong] ,wall charger,a europe to US pin converter and a booklet)nevertheless the quality of the product looks very good. The phone works with my current T-mobile SIM. However i would still need to validate if it would work outside the country as its an unlocked phone but believe so, as the reviews for this vendor is very good.About the phone in general :Some known issues with Nexus one (which i knew before and was ok with it) .1. Becomes a little bit warm at the back lower panel with prolong use (about 15-20 mins of surfing i noticed this)2. This phone did not come with SD card so i could not take photos/videos as an SD card is required.3. The 4 buttons (back/menu/home/search) at the lower panel may not be very responsive like the main touch screen.. you may have to keep it pressed for a sec or so.. you would be able to master this after couple of uses. the phone is better than torch, iphone, curve, xperia, LG or Samsung phone.
