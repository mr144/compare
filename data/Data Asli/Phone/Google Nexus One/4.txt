I love this phone. It is such a great purchase! Got it really quick and have had no problems with it.EDIT: So I have had this phone for about 60 days now, right after the 30 day return was up I started having problems with it. I have ended up doing a factory reset about 6 times now and it is too much. It's been no end of trouble, half the time apps will force close (including system apps), the phone will lock up, it'll freeze on reboot which means another reboot again. It locks up when calling people so the only way to hang up is to take the battery out. I tried, I can not take it anymore.I spoke to Amazon and they were kind enough to let me send it back.
