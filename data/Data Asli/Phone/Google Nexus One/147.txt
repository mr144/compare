for a phone you can buy directly from Google for $75 less.This is a great phone - as other reviews have stated.  But I am not not sure why this company would bother 'OEM'ing the product at a higher cost than what you can buy it for  aretail' directly from Google.  Does not make sense...oh well buy the phone, but do not do it here.
