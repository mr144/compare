I was contemplating getting the Samsung-made Nexus S, but after reports of its cheapo plasticky body and the odd shape I decided to go with the slightly older N1.  It's got that great HTC feel combined with the Android OS, and I wanted the trackball/LED feature anyway so that I would know if I have unread messages.  Although the body is sleek and well-designed, I did highly recommend also picking up an Otterbox protective case (they are without question the BEST of the best, yet reasonably priced) if you plan on buying one of these babies.
