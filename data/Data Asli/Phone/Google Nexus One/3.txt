I bought my first Nexus Google phone for over $300 in Nov 2011......and it worked just fine. I loved it! I dropped it on cement in March 2013, and the face of it shattered. I was pleased to see I could purchase a new one on Amazon for only $155 so i did. When it arrived and I set it up it worked fine. On day 3, without me having touched any settings, the screen language was a foreign language I could not read. I went online on my laptop and was able to figure out how to reset it to the original language, but problems snowballed from there. I kept getting a popup message that prevented me from using text, email or the phone. This experience was a complete disaster. I will never ever buy another Nexus phone.
