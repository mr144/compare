This is the nicest telephone I have purchased.I spent many hours while in the U.S. learning how the telephone works.The telephone does NOT come with a user manual which makes for an awkward situation.  Without a user manual is worse than driving to an unfamiliar address without a road map.  I was later able to find a 334 page user manual on the web.The main reason I do not give this phone a high rating is the fact it is not as it is advertised.  It is NOT unlocked.For someone like myself, I must have an unlocked telephone because I travel often to other countries and planned to use a SIM card from different service providers.Having a locked phone makes the telephone useless unless I am in the U.S.
