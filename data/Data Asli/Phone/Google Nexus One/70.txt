1) The phone can be used as WiFi client device without SIM2) It works perfectly with T-Mobile Pay-To-Go SIM (without data)3) It is easy to disable data access when I do not have T-Mobile or AT&T data plan, and it is also easy to enable back when I plug in a SIM card (At&t) with data plan.4) The system firmware is automatically updated to latest Android 2.3.4 version as soon as I connected to WiFi hotspot5) The GPS navigation is so easy and map is Google's MAP and it is actually better than Garmin.6) No comments on its camera since I do not have microSD yet. I got it from Amazon.com and I expected the package would include a 4GB microSD, but none.7) Very surprised that this phone can be used as 'Hot Spot'! The technical documentation does not mention it, but this is really a great feature that I thought only Nexus S model had it. I tried it and it worked as expected. Maybe it is due to the latest Android 2.3.4 OS? I love this feature and I am wondering why people would go to 'Nexus S' if this model has almost everything that 'Nexus S' supports.
