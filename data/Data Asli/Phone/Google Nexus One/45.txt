I have had my Nexus One for quite sometime now. I have had no problems with this phone, as it has done everything I asked it to without fail. The hardware of this phone has now been 'outdates' with the introduction of Dual-Core Processors running at 1.2Ghz, while the N1 is a single core at 1ghz. The screen is very bright when on the brightest setting and everything viewed will be expressed clearly, the AMOLED screen is one of the best I have seen and definitely helps this phone. As of the release of Samsung's Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus One will no longer be receiving OTA Updates from Google. Instead, one will have to root the phone and flash a ROM onto it to get the latest software. This is a shame because the phone can handle these updates and should not be considered old. I am very sad to know that Google has ended the life of the N1, but with all of its features, it is in now way obsolete.Thanks.
