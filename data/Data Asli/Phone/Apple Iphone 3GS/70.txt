Bought this used locked GSM iPhone 3GS 16GB for two reasons:1.it is sold by trust-worthy Amazon WarehouseDeals2.
it is advertised that product was 'From the Manufacturer'Received the phone in excellent shape, well packed, like new, with the latest 5.0 firmware.
It came with a new set of genuine Apple earphones with remote and mic, dock connector to USB cable and USB power adapter.
Touchscreen and battery seemed to be newly replaced as well!
Googled around, selected a company on the internet that claimed to be the No. 1 iPhone unlock service provider; after payment to them, received from them a message claiming that 'software was being developed and would be available soon (without a commitment date when software will be available)'.
Since then, I have never been able to get my money back through PayPal!
Fortunately, there's a professional independent iPhone repair shop in town (not at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell) who could help activate, jailbreak and unlock my phone; the phone works great now!
I do not have to purchase a 2-year plan, I can use the best-deal package plan I want from either at&t, T-Mobile or Cincinnati Bell any time.
One important note: NEVER update your firmware after the unlock, otherwise, everything will be reset to previous locked configuration!
