The phone arrived on time as indicated (That is good !).
Phone screen is in good condition so far and the back cover has some scracthes.
It is locked, but i have my AT&T SIM ready.
As of now, the only thing that trouble me is the missing pin that use to open the SIM slot, the rest of the functions work just fine.
I shall try to post more of this phone review, so stay tune.
