The iphone 3GS works perfectly with one exception.I purchased this product in  like new condition.
There were no scratches or blemishes at all.
All the programming works great.
My one complaint is the menu button at the bottom.
It does not 'click' crisp at all.
When you press it it feels like there is something jammed in it below the surface.
it is not bad enough to return, but does not earn 5 stars either.
