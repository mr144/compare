I got the phone in record time!When I first got the phone everything was as described, now when I got the phone and set it up it worked great, then it started shutting down by it self and would not turn back on unless I plugged it in, now as a technitian myself I new the battery was bad so I contacted the seller and he was very assertive and quick to fix issue, he offered to send me another phone but I could not be without my phone so, I told him I bought a new battery to put in it, so then he offered to refund the amount of the battery and shipping cost!
He was very quick and responsive to my needs and I am very pleased.
I also put new battery in phone works great!
I am thinking of buying another iPhone 3GS for my mother and this company will be the one I most definitely will be going through hands down!
Also the iPhone was packaged in original box with factory paperwork and the charge cable, and came with a otter box defender case and earphones!
Very satisfied!
