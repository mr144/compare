After hearing everyone rant and rave about these phones i gave in and bought older one for less and it is large disappointment it is slow freezes and the lock or to blacken screen does not even work it has no way to reset except taking sim out and does not work on prepaid which is sad because most people are converting over too and i am true believer in my android which was free works great no matter where i am even in my house the iphone does not work i bought it for my fiancee and he hates it except for clearity of pics and i have digital camera if needed
