First of all, I did like to inform that with less than one month the cell phone could not be charged.On the top of that, I have gone to an apple service assistance to check the problem.
For my surprise, the technician from the store told me that the serial number from the mobile phone differ from the box.
Second, the cell phone had been opened and it was missing a screw and had a stamp glued in the chassis.
He just told me clearly this cell phone is now new.
