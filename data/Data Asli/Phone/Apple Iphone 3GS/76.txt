I ordered this phone because my old LG prime's touchscreen was starting to become unresponsive.I think this smartphone is better than LG.
So, I thought why not try out the iphone 3gs, I did heard good things about it, so I thought I would buy one.
I choose to buy it online because everybody knows at&t's prices are ridiculous.
So I bought the phone expecting not to get much for only $270.
Boy, was I wrong.
I got the phone in a nicely wrapped package and they even included a charger.
Unfortunately, the phone was locked.
But that was not a big problem, I took it to my nearest at&t store and got my number transfered to a new sim card for the phone.
All in all I am very happy with my purchase.
The phone only had a small scuff mark on the back and the battery is in marvelous condition.
