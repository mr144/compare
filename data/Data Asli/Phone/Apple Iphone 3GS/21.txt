I brought as NEW and UNLOCKED for Christmas gift for my mom.It lasts not even a month.
Completed OFF!
We lost  great memories of my newborn baby .
I just came from one local apple store and they said that the phone is NOT UNLOCKED AND IT IS NOT NEW either.
It cannot be fix because is missing some pieces.
-  I am very disappoited and sad.
