my first 3G came severely discounted with the initial 2yr plan.8mths later it was stolen.
i did not realize i couldnt purchas another at the same  didiscounted' price.
it was $3-400 to replace it.
i got the identical phone through amazone for $150.
i have yet to tell any difference, other than i use my password lock and my 'find my phone' app...after i was told by AT&T and apple they 'couldnt trace' my original phone without it (which i do not believe).
but either way...i am 'older', not the most techy person, and probably i do not use the phone to its fullest potential, yet.
but it serves my purpose thus far, and i have no complaints, yet.
seemingly as with most smart phones, its made to be dropped (very slick and sleek) so i HIGHLY suggest purchasing some sort of silicone wrap for ease of grip or some 'hard cover' to protect it from when you drop it.
its not a matter of IF, but when.
the first one i did not drop AT ALL for 8mths.
i dropped the 2nd one twice in one week...but thankfully it was protected.
