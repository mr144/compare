This review is not for the product as you may find it everywhere in the www world.This is for the quality of the product that I received from the seller - Amazon Warehouse deals.
I bought it used - like new condition.
Luckily it came with a version of firmware that is easily unlockable (as I needed a phone to use it overseas).
The quality was very good, battery holds well, screen was pristine and there were very minor scuffs and scratches on the back (which should be expected on a used piece).
The sockets and ports were well cleaned up and came with NEW headphone, power adaptor and cable !!
Highly recommend Amazon warehouse seller for this product.
