The phone was deliverrd to me still locked and we tried every attempt to unlock it without success.Some websites promised some expensive money to open the phone, and that would mean paying another money.
It was going to be my son's bday present, so I had to got to a phone store to buy another phone at the last minute.
I Felt cheated because I had paid for a phone that could not be opened or used.
It just sits here.
