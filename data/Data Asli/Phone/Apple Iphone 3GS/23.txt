Everything about the purchase was good except the battery.The item was delievred quickly, it came with all the accesories and in good condition.
However, there were big issues with the batter.
The battery life of the phone was terrible,  if I listened  to music for a hour or so right after charging the phone I would have to recharge it immediatly....same with intensive texting....and somehimes battery said 50% and it would just shut off receiving a phone call....the cell phone shut off on me so many times that I had to keep it plugged in....which entirely defeats the purpose of having a phone!
I would strongly suggest that before you buy a used cell phone you ask the seller about the battery.
In the end I returned the phone and they were quick with the refund.
I give them one star because everything was good, except the phone!!
