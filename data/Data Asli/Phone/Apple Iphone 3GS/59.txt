I am happy with this purchase.It was delivered on time.
Though it was a used phone, it looked like brand new, wrapped in a plastic, screen in mint condition and hardly any scratches on the back cover.
Included were a new wall charger, new usb cable and new headphone.
It is functionally perfect, good network, holds battery for just over a day.
Overall, a nice buy for the price.
