I bought that phone it looks real good.I went to a thrift store and found a case to carry it in.
It was brand new too.
The battery does not hold a charge for very long.
How long are they suppose to hold a charge?
I have not used it yet nor have I went to see if it was unlocked or not.
So I am wondering if the battery is good or has to be replaced.
This is my first smart phone so I am 'DUH' on the usage.
Oh on the PayPal issue I have been waiting almost a year to get money back from them and that money came from my bank account.
I did not use PayPal for payment.
So GOOD LUCK.
I love Amazon they ROCK!!!!
