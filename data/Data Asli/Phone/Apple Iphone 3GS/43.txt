I received this phone a few weeks ago and it has not been good.First when i get it out of the box the ringer/mute switch does not work, when the seller claimed it did.
Then i find that the phone dies at 50% battery.
The seller said they had no problems and it worked great.
Well, mine does not sound like a very functional phone.
I was indifferent about the broken mute/ringer switch, but then to only be able to use it for only 50% battery, is just really unusable as a phone, or even an iPod for that matter.
Be careful and ask a lot of questions!
Make sure you buy from a trusted seller.
