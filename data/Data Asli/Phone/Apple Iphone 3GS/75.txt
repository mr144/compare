The 3G is really, really slow.I did not want to sign a contract, but I needed a new phone.
Perhaps the 3GS is slow compared with the 4 and 4s, but it is plenty fast for everything I need it to do, and being able to pick it up for the price Amazon Warehouse Deals offers it for and not having to sign a contract made this an excellent purchase.
My only complaint is that the silence switch is a little wonky, but it is a minor complaint, given that the unit shipped with an immaculate back and screen, and with a sync cable, earbuds, and a wall charger.
Highly recommended for those wanting to upgrade from the aging 3G but are wary of signing a new contract with AT&T.
