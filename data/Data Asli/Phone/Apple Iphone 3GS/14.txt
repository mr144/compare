I needed to replace an old 3G iPhone that was having too many problems to keep fixing.The 3GS added 8GB of memory, a better camera, runs on the current operating system and still fits the old case that I did not want to replace.
If the battery life was a little better this would have had 5 stars, but the battery is a bit weak.
(Not surprising for a used iPhone, however.)
