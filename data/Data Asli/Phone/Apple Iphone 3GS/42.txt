i purchased this phone trusting that it is really unlocked.Apparently Amazon does not really check these things.
I am outside the country now and can not make any calls as i keep getting invalid sim message.
And then to make it worse,its a dead battery.
Only a red battery line shows on the screen and this makes the phone trip off after 2 minutes.
I am so sad
