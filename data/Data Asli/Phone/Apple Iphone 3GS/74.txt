The used Apple iPhone 3GS I ordered from Amazon Warehouse is incredible -- just like new!And it is so far superior to the Motorola Atrix I had.
Touch works perfectly -- no accidental strokes, no opening something by mistake.
Synced with all my info on computer quickly, so now have ALL contact info including ALL phone #s (not just mobile), addresses, & emails.
Also calendar info and notes.
I have ATT contract, so just inserted SIM and it was up and running.
Shipping was fast.
Very pleased with purchase.
