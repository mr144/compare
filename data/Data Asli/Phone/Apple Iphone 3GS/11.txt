ok other than the 4s this is the most badassness phone you can hold.one thing i liked about this phone over the 4s was the way it feels.
that curve round shape at the back oppose to the 4s box design.
I actually would get a 3gs if it had a front cam and the same horse power as a 4s(some apps are really slow- see infinity blade) for the 4gs.
With siri this phone is really great.
It can hang in there with most devices released in 2010-2012.
You can grab one online for about 50-100$ so you are saving money here if you prefer something small with a nice gribby design :-)
