hello.I made the purchase of wireless equipment iphone 3gs, it is locked by AT & T, also just told me via phone that it can not be unlocked by having no bill authorized agent at & t and additionally it is reported as being stolen .
I request that you are sending to another device (unlocked, and legal bill at & t) or my money back via giftcard or similar.
I am from Venezuela, so the shipment and return the equipment I find difficult, but not impossible, so I requested to indicate which way to send your unit and I point out when I sent mine.
