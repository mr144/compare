I received what I ordered and the description matched what I anticipated.Glad to own this phone.
One problem is they discontinued the 3G so it only goes up to iOS 4.2 which is not high enough to install most apps.
The phone is slower than the 3GS but you get what you pay for.
Not bad for the price I got it for.
