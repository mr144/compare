it is a bit slow for what it is, nowadays, and most software only barely gets to it.it is somewhat slow, but still fairly powerful.
However, be sure that you are getting a factory unlocked phone.
Several sellers are selling them as simply iphones, but if you try using a different sim card, it will not work, or it was hacked to allow this.
So be sure of what you are getting!
Although, I think this smartphone is better than LG, Samsung, blackberry or sony.
