I bought this phone specially because it was described as UNLOCKED.When I received my phone everything was ok until I put the SIM card, phone did not work and I had to pay initially US15 to unlock the phone, next day when I tried to download applications I could not because the phone was not updated to ISO 4.3 or plus.
Then I had to pay US$25 to update the phone to IOS 6.0 and unlock the phone for ever.
I contacted the seller and he replied saying how he could help I told him to refund the initial $15 dollars I spent he replied just saying he did not know how to refund the money and never replied to any of my following emails.
In fact the phone was in really good condition  but locked I had to pay totally $154 + $40 to repair.
No happy with the shopping and the seller
