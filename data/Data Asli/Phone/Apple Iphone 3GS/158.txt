The phone worked fine for a couple of months.Then it sporatically would not turn on or take a charge.
Of course this happened a few weeks outside the warranty period.
No problem, I took the phone to an apple store for a diagnosis and repair.
Apple's report after opening the phone: It has a nice face but, contains multiple non apple parts.
