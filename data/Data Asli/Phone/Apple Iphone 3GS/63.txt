i wish i had done this 2 yr back ,brand new phone, Samsung Galaxy .This smartphone is lot better than samsung.
every money tight should buy this phone .
sound quality is not good as nokia and certain features are missing as comparison to new 4s siri do not works on it ,screen touch  is little slow to fluid flow  ,so buy a otter box case from amazon its dirt cheap too .
so finally very glad i have finally what i wanted .
loving it and it will go a long way with me until new iphone 5 came out .
