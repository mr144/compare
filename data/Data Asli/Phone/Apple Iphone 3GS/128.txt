Not a whole lot to say.I was kind of skeptical of ordering another &#34;unlocked&#34; phone here on amazon, due to the issues I encountered ordering a Droid 2 Global (which, by the way, was not unlocked and did not have the right software on it).
But, to my pleasant surprise, the Iphone was really unlocked.
Everything was in the box and in great shape.
It really looked brand new to me.
It was ordered for a friend, so I do not have it, but I did give it a good &#34;once over&#34;.
This seller is the real deal.
You can order a phone from here with confidence that you'll get what you pay for...
