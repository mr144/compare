My phones category was ,,unlocked phones', but when I received it was locked and it had the second problem too: when I tried to charge phone, on the screen displayed: ,,charging is not supported with this accessory'.With my friends original cable it charged fine.
I repaired my phone at the apple dealer and paid $30.
Amazon has refund my money and I am very satisfied of its service.
