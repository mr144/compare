I have the ATT version for over 3 years since 2009.It has bee going strong and no issues.
I have upgraded to version iOS 6.1 as of Nov 2012.
iTunes is the painpoint, with tough to use.
By early Dec 2012, Apple is supposed to come out with a new version of iTunes with easy user interface.
There are ample reviews of these phones, my point here was about reliability of the product.
It has come handy at all times, with no major reboot issues/hanging etc.
