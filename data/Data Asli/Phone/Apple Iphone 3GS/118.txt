i purchased the iphone 3g used -like new and to my surprise the phone looked new and came in its original box and charger.i used it immediately and had no trouble with it.
well, maybe just one!
i did not know how you put your sim card in?
but, i called my nephew and he explained since, he had one prior.
so, easy after sim card in.
did not have to call my phone carrier or anything to make any changes.
i am very pleased with my purchase.
and the sellers got it to me in a short few days.
