I am in Afghanistan and the only iPhone that will work here is a 3g but it must be unlocked, add listed this as unlocked and it was also on the box when I received it, but it was not unlocked it still required an AT&T sims card failing to recognize the local cards here.can not download an unlock program etc due to connection issues...so I ran it over with an MRAP because I can not return it from here.
Nice job Amazon !!!!!
