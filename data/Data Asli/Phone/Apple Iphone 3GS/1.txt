Overall, I changed my mind.While the phone was not as described, it is not bad at all.
I do still have to clean it up a bit from the adhesive, but it is not a big deal, especially for such a low price.
Customer service was excellent.
The problem was resolved with a partial refund for it is condition, and I am happy with that.
