The iPhone 3G is the second generation of iPhone, and was introduced on June 9, 2008.So as of May 2013, it is a 5 year old device!
It was stte of the art in 2008, not anymore.
It is amazing it is still in top 10.
Granted this is unlocked, but it will perform really slow with modern apps.
And the battery!
Beware of that also.
If you are going to browse/email, and yes phone using this device it is a good buy after all.
do not expect to play the high adrenaline car racing games with this phone.
