I bought an iPhone 3g from Amazon a week or so ago and am so far quite pleased with it.The phone allows me to use WiFi and GPS which my old phone did not have.
The iPhone also has a nice camera which my old crappy phone did not have and organizes texts much better.
I like that I can get apps from the Apple store too.
Found one that is being developed that I am excited for called Vespyr Sports, heres their video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqiitA3TsWY and facebook: http://facebook.com/Vespyr
