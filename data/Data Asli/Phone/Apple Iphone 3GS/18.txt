I love this nifty phone because i can unlock it and then use another carrier of GSM like T-mobile.This is something i will have until ios 7 comes out since iphone 3gs wont support it.
To make this even more special amazon sells these phones and apple does not or other companies since semtember 2012 these iphones are for sale in store.
In the package came the Iphone itself, a sim card removal tool, New Earphones, and a New USB connector.
Overall I am happy with this iphone until IOS 7 comes out then i will upgrade.
