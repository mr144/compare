I bought this phone used through the Amazon Warehouse Deals.It is the best smartphone.
I was not expecting much, but I figured that if anything was wrong, I could simply return it.
The box arrived in a few days, and I am not exaggerating when I say that this phone was just like new.
It came in its original packaging, with all of the accessories and manuals, and there were no visible scratches.
The only thing that let me know that the phone was used was that the port where the charger goes and the speakers had gotten a little dusty.
So, in short, the phone arrived in like-new condition.
As for the phone itself, it is worked fine for me so far.
I have been using it for about two weeks now, and I have not encountered any problems.
The only complaints I have are about AT&T and their service, not the phone itself.
It bears repeating that if you get this phone, it is not unlocked and you are stuck with AT&T.
If you can make peace with that, and one is on offer from Warehouse Deals, I highly recommend getting this phone!
