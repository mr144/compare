The seller said this product was refurbished, but it was not refurbished with Apple components and there are some things wrong with the phone: the home button only works one out of three times (so I have to push it a lot before it actually works), and no matter how loud I set the volume for the ringer when a phone call is coming through, it will only vibrate.Most of all, though, I am disappointed that I was led to think this was Apple-factory refurbished, yet there are non-Apple parts in the phone, which means they are not working as well as they could be together and some functions of the phone are very slow.
I have bought refurbished products from apple.com directly and have never had this problem, so I believe that this phone was improperly refurbished by a non-Apple party.
