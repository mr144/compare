The phone arrived promptly and in good condition.Initially it worked great until I tried to upload apps, pics, and contacts.
It then became frozen.
I have taken it to both an AT&T store and the Apple store.
Neither store was able to restore it.
I have an appointment  this weekend for additional repairs to try and restore the phone.
