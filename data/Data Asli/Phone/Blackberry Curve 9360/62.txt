I ordered the Blackberry Curve 9360 Unlocked and I absolutely love it! It is everything it says or claims to be - I love a blackberry phone.I switched from an Android. I enjoyed that phone alot too because it was touch screen 'but Motorola kept me from enjoying it . The Moto-Blur feature on that Android phone always glitch that was very annoying and irritating to say the least. So thank goodness for my Blackberry Curve 9360 _It rocks!!!
