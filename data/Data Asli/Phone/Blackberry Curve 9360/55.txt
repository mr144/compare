i could not believe in that. it does not matter if you are connected to the net through WiFi or not, unless you do not have a special blackberry data plan for this unlocked device you can not even setup an email account. i could get this phone for FREE with plan i HAD to purchase just to use as simple thing as email. why nobody mentioned this important future in their reviews???by the way, for those who experience problems with blackberry battery life, just remove those facebook tweeters and other social network guys, and you battery will be back to life.
