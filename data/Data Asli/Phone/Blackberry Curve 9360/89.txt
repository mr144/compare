Finally got my package and when i opened it i was presented with a white box labelled movistar with a blackberry sticker on one side. I have purchased several blackberry phones before and never have they been packaged in this manner - as everyone must know by now they come in a black box. The headset does not appear to be an original either. To make matters worse all the documentation included in the box is in spanish which was more than a little irritating. I have only had the phone for a few hours but other than what i mentioned above it seems to be fine. I am actually liking the phone more than expected. Good buy for the money - just concerned about whether or not i was given an original product or some sub-stardard version.
