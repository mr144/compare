It's a nice phone, works great, runs smooth and fast. Overall this is a great phone although small it has amazing batery life even while playing music or calling all day, the flash is brighter then my digital camera, it has an amazing flashlight app. I would definitely recommend it for people who have no budget for an iPhone or an Android phone. This phone is perfect for those who are light users; if you are a power user, I do not recommend this phone as it lacks the processing power to satisfy your needs.Pros: slim and compact with a tactile physical keyboard, OS 7 runs very smoothly, Reasonable price
