Dear Seller, the BlackBerry phone is to be used in Latin America. Please double check before shipping that the phone supports 3G bands 1,2,5,6. You can do that by turning on the phone and going to All > Options > Device > About Devices Versions > need to say '3G Bands 1,2,5,6' on the 3rd line. Or alternately you can ship a BlackBerry with the AT&T Logo. Please DO NOT SEND a phone with any other logo.
