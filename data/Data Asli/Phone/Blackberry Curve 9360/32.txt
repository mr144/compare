The phone is slow as most Blackberry's but this feels very cheap in the hand, is like if they set out to make a phone that feels almost like a toy. The camera is terrible as most Blackberry's cameras are. The information a bout the bands is wrong since this wont work on all the carries as it should since it is a quad band phone.Si estas en Venezuela no lo compres porque no funciona con Movistar ni Movilnet en 3G solo levanta 3G con Digitel, aparte son de mala calidad, compre dos y uno me vino da&ntilde;ado.
