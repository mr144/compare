I have not been able to get more than 4 hours between fully charged and a dead phone. I do not make a lot of calls - mostly emails and text messaging (and a bit of camera use) - i had to buy a spare battery to carry with me just so I can get through my day at the office without having to recharge the phone. When I go out at night, i have constantly had the phone battery drain and turn the phone off on me. Very frustrating problem that I have never had with other Blackberry units.
