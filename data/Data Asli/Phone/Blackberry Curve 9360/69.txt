For those with experience with Blackberrys then you will appreciate the necessary additions and upgrades.  However, if you are unfamilar to the product (or have not used it in a while like me), it def a phone to get used to.I did not like that you need a BB data plan to access certain features like apps, bb protect, fb, twitter.  But if you do not have a data plan you can always connect to a WiFi network and use the general browser.Another thing that I do not like about the phone is that the battery life is absolute shite.  Im going to have to buy a bb battery extender in order to use this phone for longer than a day.Otherwise, sleek look, portable, beautiful layout (sometimes confusing) and wide customization you can do
