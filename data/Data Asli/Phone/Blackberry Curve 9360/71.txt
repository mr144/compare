Blackberry Curve 9360 Unlocked. I purchased the Blackberry 9360 from Amazon.  I bought it because I will be travelling internationally and wanted to be able to use the Wi-fi calling feature on my carrier, T-Mobile.After 5 hours of very frustrating calls with T-Mobile Customer Care (who told me different things every time I called), three hours of our Tech Guy working the problem and 4 calls with Blackberry Customer Service in Canada I found out that the phone is from an 'unknown' carrier in East Africa and there is no way that I can put the T-Mobile software and calling features on it that would allow me to make Wi_Fi calling.Not possible.So buyer beware.  I now have spent twice what it would have cost me to buy it directly from the carrier and I do not have what I want.  In fairness, the other features of the phone work fine, but if you are considering purchase of a Blackberry or other phone on Amazon because you want access to features and benefits your carrier offers you may be quite frustrated and disappointed.
