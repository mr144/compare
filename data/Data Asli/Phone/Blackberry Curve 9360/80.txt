This is an awesome little phone and I have had 2 androids previously.  I found Android to be full of bugs that hindered its use.  Both of the phones I had previously (LG G1 and Samsung Exhibit II 4G) had countless software problems, most importantly horrible power management that required me to leave the screen on the lowest level just to make it through the day.I think of this Blackberry as kind of like a convertible, it is a neat little phone but you may need a larger tablet type phone or device depending on what you are trying to do.Pros:- Easy to use, terrific for email, the keyboard is essential for me.  I was making embarrassing mistakes on Google's 'swype' which functions extremely poorly.  I find the keyboard the best and most accurate of any device.- I like the way you can click on a contact and see all emails, texts, phone calls, all at once.- The calendar is so nice and easy to use- Battery (like all Blackberries, the battery lasts 2 days).  You do need to update the phone software to 7.1 however.- Maps works better and faster than the Android map program, which seems to stall endlessly and is slow as a snail.Cons:-  The app store:  it is OK but the apps are definitely not as good and there are not as many as the iPhone.  Android is starting to get better apps, but Android's horrendous power management will suck any joy out of using any application.- Small screen size- Internet browser worse than iPhone, Android.So it depends what you value.  This is a fun device, very small and thin, and gives you the full Blackberry email with an excellent keyboard.
