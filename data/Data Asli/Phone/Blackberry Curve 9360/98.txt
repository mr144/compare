The phone is branded t-mobile is not an oem product. at least in my case I use the network services movistar in Venezuela does not work with 3G services should be required to place in the description of the phone if it is oem, at & t, t-mobile so the buyer could make a better choice and not feel unhappy when they receive a product that not  wanted in my case I live in Venezuela and I can not return the phone to the seller
