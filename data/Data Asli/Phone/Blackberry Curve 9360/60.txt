After a thinking for awhile I decided by 9360, considering price/'performance' ratio. well, the phone itself is ok: works well, no hang ups, pretty fast (I do not really understand the 'need' for 4 cores processors for cell phones... to do what? it is just a cell phone after all. smart, well, maybe. do you really need a 4 Core processor for chat, checking email or to open some web pages? I do not think so. Higher speed processors, mean higher power consumption, shorter battery life...), really nice and slick case design, well built, pretty good quality camera, flash. The real problem of this phone is short battery life: it comes with a a tiny 930mA battery, which drains completely with in few hours, even if you do not talk or chat... When I realize that, I wanted to throw the phone against the wall... Well, after reading for awhile, I find some possible measures to improve the situation: I upgrade the OS to 7.1 (the phone came with 7.0), and disabled 3G... After that, the battery lasts whole day (from 7am to 10 pm), including a lot of chat, email and phone calls. which I consider is acceptable, although, could be much better (8900, I had before, lasted as twice as long, under the same conditions). Well, also I got a hi capacity (2340mA) battery, which was supposed to help a lot, but I have been unable to make it work, since RIM encodes batteries, in order to prevent the owner from using aftermarket batteries, which I consider pretty ugly, because they are unable to manufacture decent batteries...In order to finish this, I would say that the I feel pretty satisfied with this phone, although it requires some improvements, mostly, regarding battery life
