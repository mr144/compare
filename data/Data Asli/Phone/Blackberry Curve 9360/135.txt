Good bye Bell,  hello freedom 65I easily hooked up the unlocked 9360, kept my house number, with Koodo and the phone works great. Lots of apps and very easy to operate all the extras that come on the phone. Works off my wifi to allow me to read my mail anywhere in the house.This phone is very smart and what a difference from my previous one.
