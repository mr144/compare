I ordered my BB on Christmas night. Through the Christmas and New Year's holidays... the order still came on time! Amazing! Nothing was missing! Everything was working perfectly! Unfortunately, this phone is a gift and not for myself... now I wish to keep it! This phone has absolutely everything! It's better than an iphone! It looks so professional and sleek!The only thing is... the charger... the charger plug does not fit into my outlets in my walls. No big deal, the charger is designed to fit a European outlet and not an American outlet. But I can easily fix this because the charger wire and charger hookup is not connected, so I can simply buy one to fit a regular American outlet instead. Not a problem at all. In fact, this makes this phone fit any plug because the wire that connects the phone is by itself... giving that the wire has the ability to have different type charger plug connections on the other end of the wire (opposite of wire connecting BB) depending on what country a buyer is in. I hope this makes sense... (I am sure reading the details of the phone would also explain it).This phone also is so small! But the buttons are still big enough to press! It's so sleek! fits perfectly in the pocket, or anywhere you put it! It's durable too, but that does not mean you should drop it. Treat it like treasure! This phone is as good as gold!
