It is said that it came for the T-mobile brand, but t was not like that in my case. I was hoping it had the bands unlocked for T-Mobile ( the only one that works in 3G here in Venezuela for DIGITEL) and it came with different brand. NOT PLEASED with that.  Next time at least put on the expecifications of the products the BANDS the mobile works with. So at least one decide to buy it or not.
