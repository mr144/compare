The phone is slick and light. The keys are beautifully and practically laid out making it a breeze to type on. Screen resolution is great and easy on the eyes. The feel and weight took some getting used to coming from a heavier and bulkier Bold 9700. I might very well have to put it in a case to give me the illusion that I am actually holding a phone in my hand. The one criticism I have, and its a major one, is the battery life. It sucks!!! Coming from the Bold 9700 where I could get up to three days of light to moderate use, its a hard pill to swallow having to charge the 9360 almost daily. Hugely disappointed with this and that is why I say it could have been great. this smartphone only better than LG Optimus and Galaxy Ace. I hope RIM will announce an upgraded battery for this phone or an updated OS that is not as power hungry. All in all, fairly decent.
