I had to return this phone.  I could not stand it.I expected it to be a step up from the 8520 I have had for a couple of years -- and it was not.  Ridiculous battery life -- had to plug it in several times a day, even without that much use.  Lousy phone quality.  Very difficult to browse.  Freezes up.  Yes it was pretty, but that's its only redeeming feature.  Things you can do on the 8520 in 2 clicks take 5 clicks on the 9360.After 2 weeks of frustration I threw in the towel. This smartphone is worse than torch, xperia, nexus, iphone, lumia, htc, motorola. This is the worst product i ever purchase.
