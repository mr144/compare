Received an item in timely maner.It came in a box,with older version of headphones,not newer one. Also I did not receive memory card.Bought the phone for my girlfriend and she loves it.Phone is working fine after a month of use. I would give it 5 stars b/c headphone/mem card issue  4..good deal definitely.
