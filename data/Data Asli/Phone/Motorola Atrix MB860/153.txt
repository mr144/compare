I know that this phone is powerful, and that you might be tempted because of it is current price.but do not be fooled, I have purchased the Atrix 4G a little over a month now, and I can honestly say that if you do not mind carrying multiple batteries or the charger with you all the time, then is phone it is not for you.The biggest problem I had with it was it is battery life, I mean this thing comes with battery (BH5X)rated at 1500 Ma/h that does not last more than 6 hours, I have tried a different one and the results were exactly the same, even with little to no use it will not last more than 10 to 12 hours. but we are talking having battery saver mode on battery saver, which disconnect data sync after 15 minutes of inactivity throughout the day and night, brightness on auto and dim enabled. even with all that the battery had been draining quick. so if you browse the web, watch videos,take photos and play games constantly, you will have to plug in this phone like every few hours if not sooner. I hope this review will warn anyone who is looking forward into buying this phone. but apart from that the phone's screen looks amazing, takes decent pictures ( Not very well under low light conditions) and plays games like Nova 3 as good as a game console. Mainly because of the Tegra 2 processor it has.
