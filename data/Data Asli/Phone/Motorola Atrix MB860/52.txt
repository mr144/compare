All in all, I really loved this phone when I had it.  Lightning fast and the fingerprint scanner was darn cool!!It will not get the upgrade to ICS, which means it is stuck on the antequated Gingerbread OS.It did not bother me when I had it too much..I used this phone A LOT.  Every day I averaged about 2 hours of music and constant texting.  Calls and multimedia messages throughout the day and it did not give me much trouble.I did have an issue with it rebooting randomly when I tried to put it into my LapDock, but whether that was a software or hardware issue, I will not know.The camera was great and the screen was pretty good too (nothing compared to the super AMOLED display on my new RAZR HD) but it was good for the time period it was made in.  The dual-core processor was also slick and never slowed down.All-in-all, if you are on the fence about this phone, I say GO FOR IT! You will not be disappointed by getting it, although the lack of ICS is frustrating, if you have a little phone know-how, you can port ICS to the phone
