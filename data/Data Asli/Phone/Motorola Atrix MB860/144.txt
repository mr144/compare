This phone has to be one of the most underrated phone. it is fast, beautiful and quite powerful. I am not much fan of large screen phones, 3.7 - 4.3 inch is what I feel best. it is real handy, has a very good processing speed and graphics coupled with 1GB RAM and surplus internal memory (16GB), there's a memory slot for extra storage aspirants. Although the phone does not brags like others - RETINA DISPLAY, SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY whatever, the qHD screen is exquisite - crisp and clear.The best thing is it comes with a Headset, and all the ingredients such as USB, Battery, Dock - you can enjoy your multimedia or read PDF books with ease. The battery life is good, not like what other users said. I turn the Wi-Fi off most of times, perhaps I achieve a better battery life, but do some gaming and watch movies.For your information, the phone is an unlocked international phone i.e not an AT&T or T-Mobile unlocked phone. Therefore, you can use this phone anywhere in the world. However, I am using it with an AT&T SIM and it is working fine. If you are looking for a phone with the best price, do not think twice. But it, straight away.
