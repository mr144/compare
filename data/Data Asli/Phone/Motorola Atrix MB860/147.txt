I switched from iPhone 3g to this phone due to the hype regarding this phone. After I upgraded to Android 2.3.6, I found a lot of issues with this phone. Internet browser crashed, phone rebooted by itself, phone unresponsive and hang. Basically a total disapointment. No wonder this phone did not sell that well. I had a motorolla phone before atrix 4g and had problem within a year. Lesson learn I will not buy any motorolla phone anymore. Hopefully after google bought motorolla mobility their quality can be improved.
