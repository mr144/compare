i am irritated with my motorola atrix 4g which i purchased via best buy 8/2011.Around oct 2012 it would not charge, the screen started freezing and i had very predictable dropped calls when the phone would heat up. My husband has the exact same phone purchased 1 mo after mine. He has 10% the problems i have.sometimes i cannot make telephone calls as the phone freezes up. I purchased the best buy geeksquad insurance plan and they have given me 2 different refurbished atrixes. Best buy geeksquad actually does not repair phones they just sent it back to their dysfuntional motorola warehouse. It is such a burden to go to best buy to get a loaner phone, transer data etc. I have done this process three times. Fortunately att is shipping me samsung galaxy 3 phone. I will be back here reviewing it.
