After months of doing A LOT of research, this is the phone that I bought. I am very pleased. I love the fingerprint recognition. I have yet to buy an SD card, and so far I have not come close to running out of memory. It took a little getting used to as far as the screen appearance and where the settings and things were. but after I figured that out, I was good to go! The ONLY issue that I have come across is this: the battery refuses to reach 100%. Originally it did, and  there were no issues, but all of a sudden recently, it sets and 90% for hours on the charger. I am not sure if this is a specific issue for me alone, or what, but it is only a minor thing so far.So in conclusion, I am very satisfied with my very first smartphone. Hello info at my fingertips, here I come!
