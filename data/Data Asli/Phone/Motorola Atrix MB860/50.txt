I purchased this Item  on 11/4/12.  Now it is four months later and the photo and video function has stopped working.  I suspected that this dealer has sent me a reconditioned phone.  I paid for a new phone.  I owned this phone before and replaced it with the one I purchased through Amazon.  This Amazon seller Miki_Blue_Eyes #1 in Customer Service sold it.  What a scam. Now I have a phone which I loved that doesent work after only four months. If this can not be resloved I will just close my account and not use Amazon again.  Things like this hurt reputations and faith in online purchases.
