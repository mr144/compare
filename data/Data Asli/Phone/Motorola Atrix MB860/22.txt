Maybe this is useful for some people that want to buy this phone, i buy it from Cell Lounge Inc and it come it the retail box and with this accesories:Multimedia dock (with this you can use webtop and connect usb devices to the phone, you have to buy the micro hdmi cable)HeadphonePhoneBack battery coverChargerUsb cableThe webtop works great but it is not a substitution of a netbook, the phone is awesome and for this price i think is the better in the market, the only disappointed is that the power's cord's not work in USA you have to buy an adapter to the charger, and a new power cord for the dock, but i buy it for about $3, so this is no a big problem, remember that i buy it from Cell Lounge Inc.
