This cell phone is one of the best I ever had.Touch screen works awsome..I can read my emails, gps works fine, wireless and other functions works great.The only thing that I do not like is battery duration for work...before this cell I had BB and the battery has more time to work. I need to carry my car charger all the time for work all day without gettin off.I really recommend this, definitevely Motorola has great products.
