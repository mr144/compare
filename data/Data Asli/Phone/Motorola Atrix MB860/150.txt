For the price, it is just an amazing cellphone. I Highly recommend NOT to buy the at&t unlocked version, it is better to get the european factory unlocked cellphone. Away from that point, it really is an amazing machine. It gets almost no lag even though you have every screen with multiple live widgets, it is a monster when it comes to storage capability, with its default internal 16gb, it can be expanded 32gb more with a microSD card, making it a 48gb cellphone. It can be customized with either the android widgets or with the motoblur ones. Motoblur sometimes is a little messy, but it will become a powerful tool once you get the hang of it. It has a 5MP camera with dual led (the flashlight app is a blinding light!) gets quite good pictures.If you want a phone that can be your great storage ace, this is it. A powerful machine processing data and an even more powerful one in the storage department. Also if you want a secure phone, the biometric lector for the fingerprint works just fine, and will make your phone a mobile fortress. I highly suggest to get the otterbox commuter for this phone, it will become much more natural feeling in your hand and will protect it from ANYTHING, since it comes with a screen protector also.
