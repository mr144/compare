The Atrix 4G is indeed a top-notch Smartphone without doubt ! It is a fantastic piece of hardware with a very responsive screen.Could anything have been done differently for this phone ? Yes, may be a metal casing instead of a plastic casing would have served this iconic phone better. Also a few more color variants including one in White would have been great !
