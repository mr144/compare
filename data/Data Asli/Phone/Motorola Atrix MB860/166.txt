I have been very lucky when it comes to choosing phones. I used to have the Blackberry 8900, then I had the Blackberry 9780, which was my last phone, and they were both very good phones, I never had any trouble.BUT NOW, I have entered the Android experience. This is a very powerful and surprising phone. it is incredibly fast, confortable and versatile.I used to think that Blackberry was made more for the executive/lawyer/traditional business men, while Android targeted the 'young' users that seek heavy hardware for gaming/entertainment...... but now I know I was mistaken.I have never had a better browsing experience, it is fast, smooth and very user friendly, THE PHONE makes it all very easy with the universal search button.AWWW, the news features..... sweeet! Now I can sync with a news widget that updates PERMANENTLY with every news source you want LOCAL and INTERNATIONAL. The same goes to the weeather widgets.Pictures are very good, video recording is incredible, the calendar is very well designed.I am very happy with this phone, I recommend it.SOME WARNINGS: I have had it for just 1 week now. It tends to get very hot while in use (not even heavy use, just normal use), and BATTERY LIFETIME IS NOT VERY GOOD!!! It only survives in regular use like 10 or 12 hours.
