I bought this phone back in July.  I did some research and what sold me was that it had a duel core cpu and a very large screen.  Also I wanted to be able to use the lapdock.  I use this phone as a computer more than I use a computer at this point!  It is fast, I have never had a lock up.  The Android 2.3 upgrade is awesome and it was one of the first android devices to get Netflix.  If you tweak the settings to shut down un needed things when  not being actively used, I can go all day without charging it.  It also has a very long life while watching videos.  I was very impressed.If you want a droid device, this is your phone :)
