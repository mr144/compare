After 4 years with iPhone, I got rid of Apple and switched to Motorola. I use T-Mobile; and several of my iPhones were giving me too much pain with T-Mobile.I LOVE Motorola Atrix! Super fast! Does more than I need! All the apps I need are there!Took me a few days to find my way around; but with very little pain. I have used many phones from various manufacturers and am pretty savvy with high tech gadgets.I LOVE Navigation that does not require any monthly charges! I love music player that is compatible with multiple software packages. I love the picture and video quality. I love the easy way to access all the files on the device.Much less expensive than iPhone, but not a bit behind in performance and functionality.
