I am from Australia. Having read a lot of good reviews here, bought one from ebay. After using about six months, I saw a workmate using the phone. I asked him how it was going. He said touch screen is ---ked and he was about to chuck in the bin. Not long after, I start getting problems with the screen. Now I throw it away and get a new phone. A techaician says digitizer is damaged and would cost me aboout $150.
