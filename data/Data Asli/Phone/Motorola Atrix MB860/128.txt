The phone arrived when promised, packaged in a plain Motorola box with battery, charger and battery cover.  The phone starts with an AT&T screen.  I activated the phone with a Straight Talk sim easily enough, although, on starting the phone, I had to be quick to bypass the opening screen before an error message occurred indicating a non-AT&T sim had been inserted.  After activating, the phone has worked flawlessly in all respects.Straight Talk requires the manual setting of a new APN in order to have internet access.  As long as you can follow instructions, it is easily enough done.  My only complaint is that the Atrix did not come with the cool animated weather/clock widget that my HTC Incredible has.  I am still looking for such an app.  Otherwise, the Matrix seems to be slightly more advanced and has a little larger screen than the Incredible.
