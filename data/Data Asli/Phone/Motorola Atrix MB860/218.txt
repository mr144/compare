This phone is sold as unlocked, I live in Zimbabwe and like to keep as up to date on tech as possible.  The Wifi does not work here and after receiving the phone have found on google that this is a common problem outside of the US.  No mention is made of this.Basically the phone is useless. Cannot do anything with it.  If anyone has some advice please let me know.
