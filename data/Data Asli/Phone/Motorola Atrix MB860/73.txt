I was pretty excited when I bought my Atrix a year and a half ago, but long term it has been disappointing. I had owned several Motorola cell phones over the years and stuck with them because I thought Motorola knew how to build a dependable phone.But, mine did not even make it to the two year point for a discounted replacement phone. Within the first few months of use the black plastic applied to the main on/off switch peeling off. This, however, did not seem to affect the functionality of the phone, so I ignored it. Later down the road the blue tooth function stopped working, and shortly thereafter the Wi-Fi function stopped working. A little web research uncovered that this is a common problem which can only be fixed with a new main motherboard.I continued to struggle along without those functions, but then the speaker for the ear end of the phone died. Again this turns out to be a common failure.Besides these reliability issues, the much hyped Atrix accessories like the laptopish dock, media dock and car dock turned out to be poorly thought out and poorly supported. The pseudo-laptop could only run a few outdated applications, and nothing new ever became available for it. That expensive accessory turned out to be little more than a novelty.Another recent problem is that Motorola has never upgraded this phone to the latest Android release, and consequently useful applications like the Paypal blue triangle for taking remote credit card payments will not work.Motorola was once the leader in cell phones. Now they are pretty much a joke. Sad, really.
