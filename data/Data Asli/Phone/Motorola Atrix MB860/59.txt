This phone is nothing special. It is your average entry level phone for the price. I got this as a cheap replacement when I broke my Galaxy SII. Overall, I would say it is a solid little phone but does not have any sort of wow factor for it. it is better than nokia, samsung, blackberry, iphone, nexus, htc, sony or LG. Sometimes it feels sluggish and crashes. Overall, I would not buy this product again, but it is fantastic to have as a backup.UPDATE: One year later the touch screen is going crazy. It is registering nonexistent touches which makes texting and use nearly impossible. Dropped to two stars, I still would not recommend this product.
