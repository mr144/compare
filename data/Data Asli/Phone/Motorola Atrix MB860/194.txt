Being the runner up for most innovative device at the last T3 awards, this device not only is fast but is packed with cutting edge features too. It comes with a HDMI cable which you can plug into a monitor, and the software on the phone will literally switch into something called 'webtop mode' which is just like using a normal PC. it is pretty sweet.
