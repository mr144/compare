I bought this phone in October and really loved it until recently.While playing you tube videos sometimes it is observed that the phone freezes, only a hard restartby taking out the battery works. Well, on searching the internet, many other users hasfaced a similar type of problem. This has happened twice in two months.The phone excluding this issue of 'YouTube videos' is pretty good, navigation,browser, games etc.. If the issue of you tube is faced too often, then I will have to get thephone replaced. Will let you all know my findings.
