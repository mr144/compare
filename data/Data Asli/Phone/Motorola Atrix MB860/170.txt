Update 2 March:  the seller contacted me assuring that the phone is new, but opened by them for unlocking and indicated that these are liquidation phones.  Apparently all this is dedcribed before purchase, she indicated.The phone is working fine since arriving two days ago. And I have accepted her explanation.Original post follows.It had to happen:  after thousands of dollars of purchases from Amazon for many, many years, I got ripped off.This phone - which should be replacing my original Droid - arrived today.Very disappointed. I ordered a NEW phone, I got a used one. Clearly used before: SIM card slot shows scratch marks, screen and camera lens plastic half pasted on, home-printed quick start guide, all in non-descript AT&T box much larger than its contents. The phone and charger were bouncing around inside. No HDMI cable. This is like a mickey mouse social network experience.The seller, orderinstantcom, has left its distribuitor, Amazon, with egg on its face.  Sorry folks, but it is the truth.Note: The two stars really rate the condition of the Atrix, rather than the promised Atrix features.
