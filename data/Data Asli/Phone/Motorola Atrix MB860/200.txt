I have had my phone / computer for over a month now.  I am not going to go into any detail about its various functions since other phone reviewers on the net do that quite well and I see no need to duplicate their work.  What I want to express is the thrill factor I have with this phone.  I am so picky about the things I buy that sometimes I annoy myself, and I have no criticisms of this phone whatsoever.  I did buy an app to disable the screen lock function and which also provides a numeric battery level, but I view that as personalizing to my preferences which is why some apps are created.  Sound is phenomenal, and I love securing the phone in the phone console [...] I purchased, and listen to Stitcher radio programming while I ride my bike.  It fits great in the pocket, and I can not imagine buying an iphone when you can get this phone for 27 dollars on Amazon Wireless.  I could have paid 100 plus dollars for this phone with contract and been just as happy.  I love this device and if you are a gadget guru like me, that is saying a lot.  I can not imagine that you would be disappointed with this device.
