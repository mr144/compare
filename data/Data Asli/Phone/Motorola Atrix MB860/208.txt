After 3 months with this phone, I could say it is a great gadget!!! Dual core = fast and excellent performance!! Recently, it made an update to Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), and got even better!!! Received it unlocked as it says. I could say the battery is the only con it has (mine lasts 2 days before it needs to get charged,sometimes even 3 days), but otherwise it is a great purchase and would recomend it to anyone who looks for a smartphone
