I was very impressed in this phone. I recieved it today and brand new as advertised. It was packaged very neatly and everything was included. It came with the dock wich can be used for charging and connect many different types of media like hdmi, photos music etc. This phone is super fast and loads up when turned on in less than 20 secs. Apps run smoothly, the graphics are very nice, and usability is great. The fingerprint lock works flawlessly and is easy to unlock your phone without having to remember passwords. There is plenty of storage space to save a ton of pics movies and music. Also on the home screen there are gadgets to turn on the gps,bluetooth, wifi and the push of a button. I just got this today and there is still time for me to play with it, but I know I will continue to love this phone.
