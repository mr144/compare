I bought this phone on March 31, 2012.  Here it is almost 6 months after purchasing the item (September 26th) and I am having battery problems.  The battery will not hold a charge above 90%.  it is gotten to the point where I plug it in at night before bed, take it off the charger at 5:15 am when I wake up, and the phone is telling me my battery is almost dead by 5pm.  I am giving this product a two star review in that after spending a decent amount of money on the product, I would expect the battery performance to be a quite a bit better after ONLY 6 MONTHS.I do not recommend this product to anyone based on the poor value for the money.
