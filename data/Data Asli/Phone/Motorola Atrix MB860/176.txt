Purchased this phone used in very good condition. Shout outs to The Buying Company, for their extra fast shipping and for delivering a phone with all it is accessories and in better condition than described.first thing i did once i got it up and running was download LauncherPro. If you hate Motoblur, you are going to LOVEEE this app. Other apps that are a MUST HAVE are Camera360, Sense Analog Clock, Firefox, GO Keyboard And, GO SMS Pro.I charged it for about eight hours. I Unplugged it at midnight, Downloaded about ten apps, watched five minutes of youtube, sent out five SMS, and listened to about 15 minutes of music. I went to bed at two AM and, set the alarm for nine AM, because it was going to be nice out and i wanted to run while there is no traffic. I ran for about twenty five minutes while listening to music. From eleven am to midnight, I spent eighteen minutes talking on the phones, sent and received about thirty SMS, Downloaded three more apps, And listened to about fifteen more minutes of music on my way to pick up my friend from work. When i went to plug it in at midnight again, the battery life was eight percent. I was like WOWWWWWWW!!! Now while all my friends are fighting over outlets, i ama be chillen.Another thing. This phone is fast. Like Chuck Norris' wife on her PMS coming at you fast. it is so fast a good comparison, would be the turtle from Comcast Vs. the Allstate guy in a 1ft race. The touch screen is very responsive and ninety percent of the apps open within a second. it is almost as Good as my Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket but... i am going to stop talking about it, because i am starting to tear up. I miss my skyrocket. R.I.P. dec 3, Jan 1.Last thing. The camera is as good as one of those $150.00 cameras you could purchase here, and with camera360, you could do all your enhancements.
