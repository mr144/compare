I purchased mt Motorola Atrix 4g just over a year ago to replace my iPhone 3g. It was my first Android phone and I was rather impressed with both the phone and Android Gingerbread.After about three months, the phone would turn itself off. I drove 45 minutes to the AT&T service center where they managed to get my data off the phone and switched it out. On the ride home I realized that the GPS was not working so the next day I returned to the service center. That phone seemed to work for about a week but then it too had problems. Once again I returned to the service center and they attempted to swap out the phone and could not get the replacement to work. After an hour of trying they gave up and swapped it to a different phone.After less then 24 hours, that phone stopped seeing the SD card. After numerous attempts to re-seat it the phone finally would see it without issue. I continues on with that phone until about a week ago.About one week ago my phone started to reboot itself. Then it started not being able to detect wireless networks, showing only 'error' when you looked at the WiFi settings. And then it started loosing and re-finding the SIM card. I started turning the phone off at night and finally removing the SD card as while sitting perfectly still on my nightstand it will find and initialize then loose the SD card. As of yesterday, the phone stopped being able to detect blue tooth.My general impression is that neither AT&T nor Motorola are able to properly refurbish these phones.
