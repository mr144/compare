I always buy motorola being from Ill. and never having a problem with one ever. This is my 1st smartphone and it works fine good sound I rarely use my laptop for web browsing any more. Voice commands are good camera decent, plenty of apps fingerprint lock is way cool. Sometimes it does shut down if too many things are running on it but overall just as good as any iPhone and way cheaper. I also put the 30g memory card in mine and the music has more bass than my iPod. Durable as well still recommend buying a $10 case and u good to go.
