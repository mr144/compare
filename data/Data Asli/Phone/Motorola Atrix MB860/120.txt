i had bought this phone from AT&T, and it worked really well for about 3 months, then my phone began to overheat and drain the battery within twenty minutes. i took it to the AT&T store, and it was replaced. i had the same thing happen to me two more times, upon the third return i was given a samsung galaxy s2 which i have had no problems with.
