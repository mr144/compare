I really do not understand how this phone got 5 star ratings. It unexpectedly shuts off on its own, freezes ALOT, likes to add random letters after numbers typed on the qwerty keyboard, battery does not last that long, many web sites do not work, music player sometimes skips like a cd whoch makes no sense, i could go on and on. At&t is not what i thought it would have been. Not happy with this phone or service. Cannot wait until my contract is up so i can dump this pile of garbage.
