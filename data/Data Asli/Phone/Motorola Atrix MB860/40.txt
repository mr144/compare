I bought this phone to use with my straight talk plan & it works great. Although you will find that the 4G is throttled down. 3m download 1m upload Max.  Also you cannot use different browsers such as Firefox or Opera on it.  Had to restore factory settings after I installed these.  Fingerprint scanner works ok, sometime take to many swipes to read.  Lots of apps with Google.  Over all a good phone for the price and your not tied to a 2 year contract.
