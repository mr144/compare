My brother got this phone to replace his old Samsung Galaxy Ace, and he does not stop to tell me all the features that this phone have and much he loves it. I checked the phone, seems sturdy and I am actually planing in getting myself one as well. It even has a mini hdmi port wich you do not find easily in phones this price range.Overall it seems this phone is worth every penny you pay for it.
