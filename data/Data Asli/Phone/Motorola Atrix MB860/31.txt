My contract ends tomarrow.  I have owned two of these MB860 phones in two years.  After a few months my phone screen went on the blitz and the phone would not function.  AT&T replaced my phone under warranty with the same model of phone.  this new phone also worked for a few months and went on the blitz.  Over the life of this phone I did not get my money's worth and will be glad to be free of it.  This was a lemon.
