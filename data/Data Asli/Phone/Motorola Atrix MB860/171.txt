I have owned this phone for about 10 months now. It is generally fast and the hardware is very good. The screen is very clear and the form factor is pleasing. Most of the time it works very nicely. it is the best smartphone. I really liked it at first...But the software apps and the Android OS they run on has been plagued with problems from the beginning. My biggest irritation is when it locks up or reboots itself while playing music. A recent OS upgrade fixed much of this problem, but it still happens on occasion. It has all kinds of little glitches I do not have to deal with in my iPad.One big irritation is responsiveness to the touch screen. There are times you touch a button on the screen several times and it does nothing. Very annoying. This virtually *NEVER* happens on my iPad. And believe me, I am not a religious nut about Apple products.iPad apps are more professional looking and more importantly seem to work much more reliably. I have had several Android apps get 'confused' and have to exit them and start over.I have updated the OS whenever possible. I have upgraded the flash memory. I have taken to rebooting the phone almost daily. I have used multiple bluetooth accessories for music playback. Still the buggy problems persist.As I said, I really wanted to like this phone. I did not get the newest iPhone because the 4s did not offer 4G speed and I think it is overpriced. And I wanted to give Android a chance. When my Atrix works, I do like it. But I do not have to put up with these problems with my iPad, and I am guessing the iPhone will be the same.When the next iPhone comes out, this Atrix is headed for the garbage can. it is the best smartphone. Right after I smash it with a hammer.This was my first and will be my last Motorola phone.
