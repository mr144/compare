After extensive internet research, to find a smartphone that would work on AT&T network, I chose the Motorola Atrix MB860 4G Unlocked Dual Core Phone with Android.This phone is easy to use, the screen is bright and the phone is easy to hold one-handed, if you have small hands like I do.  Android marketplace and Amazon have free apps you can download on your phone.  Phone calls are loud and clear, with no distortion when using speakerphone.  Using this phone with Wifi is also fast. However, the only minus I have with this phone, is the fact that Motorola will not upgrade this phone to Android 4.0. Otherwise, I love this phone.
