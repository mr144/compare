I have owned this phone for about 3 months now, and there is little about it I would change.  Based upon its technical merits, it is among the best phone designs available.Note:  The upgrade to Android 2.3 is essential for the best experience, which might only be available if you activate it on AT&T.My only complaint is that the phone is labeled 4G, but the HSPA+ network does not really provide performance comparable to other networks labeled as 4G (i.e. LTE).  You should expect download speeds to be optimally 3-6 Mbps with perfect signal strength, off peak.  Often , the performance is closer to 1.5 mbps.  Check with your carrier to be sure you will get the performance you expect on their network (and that HSPA+ is available in your overage area).On WiFi, I have verified that the phone can handle data rates as fast as 40 mbps.Related:  The multimedia dock is well worth owning, especially if you would like to use a keyboard and mouse to operate the phone (you can also attach a display or TV via HDMI for an even better experience).CONS: Wish it was an LTE phone.  I am sure there is a version coming that will be.
