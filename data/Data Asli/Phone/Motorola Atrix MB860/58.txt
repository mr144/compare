Well, not my first.  I had an iPhone at work that I was glad to be rid of when I left that job.  So this is my first personal smart phone and it is great.  Simple to use, not too big so I feel like I am putting a tablet to my face when on the phone, and very responsive with the dual cores.By far the neatest feature is the fingerprint sensor on the back.  So convenient to unlock the phone with just a swipe instead of always putting in a password.  NICE!!!!!!  The size and weight are just right.  Another great phone from Motorola.
