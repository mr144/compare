I buy this phone fom open group wireless, and I can not be more pleased, the phone was brand new and work perfect in my country (Venezuela).I have it, for about a month and i am still loving it, to me is't perfect size, is really fast and the best is the price, over all it is a great phone that can easy beat  in function the iphone 4 and others that are more expensive... the only thing that i am not a big fan is the camera (it is just ok), but the rest works perfect!
