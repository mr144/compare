This is the fourth or fifth cell phone I have owned and the first 'smart' phone, so I am certainly not a power-user.  Nevertheless, I find the phone easy to use, the Droid interface is reasonably intuitive and the feature-set is more than adequate.  My only real complaint is the battery.  I have only had my phone about a year and already the battery will not fully charge, no matter how long I leave it on the charger. The OE charger stopped working after a few months, so I went to my local ATT store and got a replacement, which is different from the original, so this may be part of the issue.  The battery will get to 70% charged, the little battery icon shows that it is still charging, but it never gets to 100%, and then it drains within a day, even with very light use.From what I have seen in other reviews, batteries are frequently an area of complaint, and I worked in the electronics industry so I know from first-hand experience that batteries are an issue in other products as well.  Perhaps it is just too much to expect a Droid phone with all its bells and whistles to run off a battery for more than a day, but I would like to see battery manufacturers work to advance battery technology to keep up with the electronics they support!
