I bought this as my way to get into Smart-phones.  It is simple to use other than I am not a huge fan of Moto-blur and the home screen is rather overtaken with moto-blur message screens.  Other than that the phone works fine one issue is that the Wi-Fi tends to cut out at rather odd times.  Phone signal is usually strong.
