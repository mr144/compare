Well, my english its not to good, but here it goes!The Phone it came from Ross Cellular,in the page of especifications, says that the battery should be a 1930mAh Li-On Motorola Battery, and it came with a 1500mAh Battery! thats makes that the battery runs out more fast!The box is a Blue box with Motorola Logo,what is in the box?  Complete Motorola Atrix Phone, Ac Adapter, Manual, and 1500mAh battery, did not came with the Data Cable...The phone comes with Android Gingerbread 2.3 OS, the phone reboot every 10minutes!! but i investigate on forums, and its a problem of this phone with 2.3 OS,so i rooted and Unlock the bootloader, and install another rom, Nottachtrix 4G, before that, finally i can enjoy this phone,so if you do not want to have that problem, i recommend that you read about this reboot problem or google it, could be a dealbreaker..now i am happy with this phone, its amazing, and a great phone for the price you pay!if you decide to buy it, you will enjoy for a great phone in a very cheap price...
