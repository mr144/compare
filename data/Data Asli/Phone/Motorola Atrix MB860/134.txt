First, I have to say how incredibly fast this phone came through by mail. I ordered it on a Saturday and it arrived 1 day earlier than expected. First two days, I tested the phone and saw what it was capable of. Processing power and the nVidia Tegra 2 makes this great for those graphic intensive games for the Android market (Modern Combat 3, Shadowgun, etc).So like I mentioned before, this phone worked GREAT for the first 2 days. 3rd day I was using it, the phone suddenly shut off by itself while I was in the bus listening to music. So I did not think much of it, until it happened another time while I was playing Modern Combat 3. Then 2 more times when I was not even using the phone at all.I thought a factory reset would fix the problem, but it did not. During the reset, the phone restarted again. So I checked online for a solution which some told me could be a problem with the SIM card and or other countless problems the Atrix 4G has. So I did another factory reset from the way Motorola support said, which is a hard reset by pressing the volume down button and the power button at the same time.Did that twice and still had this problems. Not even a week of using the phone and already these problems occurred. I suggest to all you thinking of getting this phone, its a great device ONLY if you are going to need it just as a cell phone. Making phone calls and minimum internet usage. Other than that, using this device for playing games or even listening to music will get the phone to restart itself 5-6 times a day.PS: Not sure about how other people received their Motorola Atrix through amazon, but when mine arrived there was a scuff mark on the top right corner of the battery cover and on the bottom left corner of the phone. So I ignored that fact when the phone first arrived, now I am just disappointed.This would be a 5 star rating if it was not for the problems. Now I am looking for another phone for the same budget as this one. it is a shame really.
