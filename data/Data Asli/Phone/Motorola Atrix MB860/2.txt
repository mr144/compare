We bought these phones so that we could break free from contract phones with verizon and switch to Straight Talk. We got these phones in the mail and my initial thought was that they looked and functioned great and came with an awesome bundle of accessories.Within the first few days we noticed my wife's phone would die within a few minutes and we tried a new battery with no luck.Data would be unavailable randomlySound only works if you squeeze the phone just rightAutomatic restarts randomlyBattery is unable to chargeWe tried to warranty the phones but it turns out they were made for Hong Kong and these people just buy overseas phones and resell them here.
