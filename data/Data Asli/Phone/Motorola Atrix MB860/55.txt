I have been wanting this for over a year now and decided to finally buy one. After watching and reading countless reviews i can say that this phone went far beyond my expectations. Although for some reason my indicator light isnt working. I did not like the fat that i needed to be connected to the internet in order to set up my phone either. I also wish that this phone could upgrade to ICS but the only way to do that is by flashing a custom ROM.All in all the phone is really nice and beautiful. It came brand new in the factory box with a tun of accessories including the media doc and headphones. I do not regret my purchase! :D
