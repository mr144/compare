The phone is advertised as 4G, however after much research, it turns out not to be. While it can operate on the 4G network, it is not truly 4G and there is no 4G indicator that you typically see on most phones. Generally, I like the phone, but it does freeze quite a bit requiring a restart. I called the vendor (Open Group Wireless) and they promised to call me back with some answers, but never did.
