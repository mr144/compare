One of my best purchase so far, Atrix surprised me with strong construction, confirmed by my friends who owns other brands smart phones. Powerful, can run most of the applications without lags, amazing video card Nvidia Tegra, runs Need for Speed Shift like in a desktop machine. High resolution display with good colors, cannot compete with Super Amoled, but is a very bright and clear LCD display. Battery is very durable for the  amachine', usually takes 1.5 day even using some GPS, Internet Wi-fi, Game and kind of other Android usual tasks. Camera is quite good, 720p videos plays very nice in my 50' plasma screen. Pictures are good and clear, when there is enough light to take them. Led flash is weak and produce no good results.Disadvantage: In my opinion, the main problem is the heating, after using it to browse internet, or see video, or play games for sometime it becomes hot. It bothers me a little bit, but I do not consider it a so relevant problem.
