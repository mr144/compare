I love this phone. I practically have not used my laptop since I have got this phone, I can do pretty much everything that I do on my pc, I watch movies, series, check work documents, and the price is really low. The only thing that I complain about is motoblur, but I changed the system to CN 7.2 and it is a lot faster, I do not think I'll be changing this phone for a really long time.
