I bought this phone from Worldwide Distribuitors. It came upgraded to Android 2.3.4. Did not inlcude the dock, nor the car charger (none of them are mentioned in the box contents), only the charger, USB cable and HDMI cable. Phone is fast, responsive, it feels well built (but I ordered a protective gel case for it). The most impressive feature of this phone is it is battery life. I can easily go through my working day without worrying about charging my phone to have battery juice while I get back home. I think it can easily go for 36 hours of normal use: email, phone calls, instant messaging, games, etc.If you plan to use it outside the U.S., you should input the APN configuration after powering it on for first time; just ask your service provider!.The screen resolution is superb, more icons fits the application screen. The MotoBlur interface is quite messy for handling Social Networking, but its excelent to manage email accounts/SMS. In fact, I do not use the Social Networking part of MotoBlur, I prefer the standard twitter, facebook apps. The size is perfect for 1 handed use. It also fits in my jean's pocket without any problems.In a short, it might not be the fastest phone around (the Galaxy S2 is faster), but I can not feel the difference between both in speed (my wife has an S2) in day by day use. Given the fact that I do not mind been 1-5% slower (in benchmarks), but having superb battery performance and a more pocketable, easier to use with 1 hand mobile, and saving over $100, I think this phone is the best choice around here.
