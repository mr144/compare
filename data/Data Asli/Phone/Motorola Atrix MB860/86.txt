I am brazilian and bougth the cell phones via Internet.When I received, I did not realize that it did not come in the original box. It came in a red box, without Motorola logo. I realize that only when I arrived in Brazil. I think that I got a refurbished item. But I was already in Brazil and decided not to return the cell phones.Now, one of them stop working... the touch screen does not work in a lot of places of the screen.
