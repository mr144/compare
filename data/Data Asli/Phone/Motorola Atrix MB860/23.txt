I have bought several ATRIX 4G's off of ebay and amazon. There are some issues with the device as well as there has been somewhat of a bad luck factor. This is an excellent device but I have had some bad luck with it. There have been some battery life issues as well. other than that, this phone is a pleasure to use specially with the new jelly bean roms. The display is just beautiful and looks really good and vibrant even in comparison with iphone4s.
