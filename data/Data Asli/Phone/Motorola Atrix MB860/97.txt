Last December (2011) we were eligiable for new phones with our ATT plan. I decided to get the Atrix, because they had good reviews, sounded like they were great phones and we could get them for $0 with a renewed contract. At first we loved them. Great volume, durable, loved the pictures, video and wifi. Come October though, my phone especially started having major problems, and I had to spend $100 to get the touch screen (digitizer) replaced. This helped for about two more months, but the problems are back and my wife's phone is having major problems of it is own. Sometimes I can not unlock mine, then other areas will not respond on the touch screen. My wife's speaker phone and mute come on, all the time now. So we have had the phones about a year, and they have become almost useless. Because I still have a year left on my contract, we have to pay full price for two new phones, or take a chance that we can spend less and get the phones fixed. The first hundred did not do the job on mine, so we are getting new ones.So, if you want a pretty good phone that will last you less than a year, go for it. If you want something that will last the life of the contract, keep looking.
