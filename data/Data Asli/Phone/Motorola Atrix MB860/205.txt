Let me start saying that this is my first smartphone, so, I can not compare against BB, Iphone, Nokia or any other Android devices.It is important to say that this phone is the AT&T version (at least the two me and my wife received). Nice, because GingerBread upgrade is already available at motorola site(recommended upgrade).Phone really came unlocked and was delivered on-time. It is connected in Venezuela, usign Movilnet Carrier.So far, phone has no flaws and works as it is intended. Motoblur does not seems to be a problem and for regular users, i do not think it is neccesary to root the phone.On screen keyb works good with swype (faster than regular physical keyb), even if it needs some practice.The only feature i still did not test is GPS.So far, transition to smartphones has been a great experience thanks to this phone.GOOD:- Big Screen and outstanding colors. But Samsung S2 has a bigger and slightly brighter one. That makes S2 harder to handle.- Great processor, video an RAM that allow touch screen and multi gestures to be very fluid. Again, S2 has a bigger processor (for 200$ more).- GingerBread already available by the manufacturer.BAD:- Because of his size, is not easy to hold as a phone (for people used to regular phones).- Screen is a print magnet (but swype works better with not so clean screen). I think all touchscreen device will have this CON.- Is mandatory to be aware of Battery level(As most smartphones). Manufacturer suggests to charge it daily, but with regular to low use, it can last even two days.
