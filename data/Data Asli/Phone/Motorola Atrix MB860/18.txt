What a great, useful and cheap smartphone. I adore how it can adapt to almost all the tasks I need. The fingerprint sensor is fantastic so do not worry about remembering PINs or patterns, just slide for finger and voil&aacute;.It can play videos on webpage without installing anything aditional, it is really unlocked, has great storage capacity so if you do not need more than 10 GB you can save some money by not buying a memory card. The only thing I do not like is that you can not update (officially) to ICS, too bad. I'll update if something comes out
