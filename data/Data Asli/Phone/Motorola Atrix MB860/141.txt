I must say this phone almost met all my expectation in an Android phone. I have had it for more than a month now.  Its really unlocked and works with any gsm network. All I had to do is insert my Sim card. So far the only problem I have with is of  course the front camera take very dark picture.Will continue to update as time goes on.
