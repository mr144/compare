Reading the reviews for this phone I thought I would be very happy, and I was for a short time. Unfortunately I found the phone slightly warm one day sitting on my desk on the charger. It was off (oddly) so I turned it on and found that it hung at the splash screen 'Rethink Possible'. Warranty replacement, fine, except about a month later it failed in the exact same way. So now I am on my 3rd phone (same model), and yesterday it started turning itself off after 2-10 minutes of being idle. The timing appears random, and the battery indicator shows 90%. it is doing the same thing this morning after a full charge, and I am using the Motorola charger and battery that came with the phone. I hope Motorola will replace it with the newer model (Atrix 2), and I'll have better luck with that. If not, I'll just eat it and get an Iphone - ugh.I do not recommend this product to anyone unless it is a gift for someone you hate, and they live at the end of a long, precarious drive with no guardrails in an area where it would be a long time for a passerby to recognize they went off the road hundreds of feet down a ravine because it was so rainy they could barely see the road and coincidentally their driver's side windshield wiper was intermittently malfunctioning and they had to use their cellphone to call for help in order to save their life because they were pinned under the steering wheel but when they went to use their Motorola Atrix 4G it would suddenly reboot and get stuck at the 'Rethink Possible' screen and that would be the last thing they saw. Under those circumstances I would rate this phone 5 stars and highly recommend it.I am on my 4th phone (my employer pays for my phone) - been quite a while with no issues, but I still hate it.
