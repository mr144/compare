Got the phone last week.It works nicely though I did expect it to be a little faster.Have the LG 2x as well, and although they have the same processor, Lg works notibly faster.camera on the Atrix is better then expected.Nice touch screen and HD video quality.Motoblur is annoying, would skip that if Motorola would kindly releave us for that duty.All together, for the price, you do not need more.I would recommend it to a friend.
