The phone is not bad its light and it is a good size, but..... mine has a case on it and there is no damage done to the screen but for some reason there are dead spots on my screen that do not work and that makes it hard to text and search for things and to play games. The areas that do not work ote the (t, g, v) the only way they work is if the phone is sideways but that just means there is different spots on the screeb that does not work. And the battery for some random reason my battery stops at two different spots it can ether be at 70% or at 90% witch really sucks for long days with no charger because by 4:00 pm after being unpluged at 8:00am it is already down to 30%
