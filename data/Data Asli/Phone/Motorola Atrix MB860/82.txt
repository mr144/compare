I bought this phone way back in March of 2010, so I have had it for almost 2 years now. It was my first smartphone, and it was top of the line back then. I loved this phone for a while. The GPS is incredibly solid, the photos are great, and the fingerprint reader was nice. However, I expected a phone of this caliber to last at least two years until my contract was up. It did not.The first thing to stop working was the fingerprint reader. The corner of it started to peel and then it just quit working. The next thing, about six months ago, was the ear speaker. What good is a phone without the ear speaker? Well, I was past the warranty, so I figured I could just use the headphone jack until my contract was up. Nope. The headphone jack went out a week ago. Now I am stuck with a nice handheld computer that I only use as a speakerphone (embarrassing) and a gps unit. I had to buy bluetooth headphones just to listen to music. I will not be buying another Motorola phone for a long time.
