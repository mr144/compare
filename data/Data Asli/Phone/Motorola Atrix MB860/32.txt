I bought this phone in 2011 I have used it everyday after I got it, so i have had two years to test it out. I have the laptop dock for it too. It was good when i first got it. It got better when they updated it to gingerbread and let me install 3rd party apps. Then one day I got a notification Motorola wanted to update the phone again. I thought the last update was good so this one would be too. I was very wrong. The only thing it did was to make my Wi-Fi disconnect its self whenever it feels like. It wont stay on for more than a couple of minutes. I have my Wi-Fi set to never sleep, and I have tried everything to fix this including factory reset. I do not know why motorola would want to ruin my phone on purpose, but they did. Probably so I would use more data or something. I am never going to buy another motorola product for as long as I live, and i would say you should not either because this is the kind of stuff they are going to pull.
