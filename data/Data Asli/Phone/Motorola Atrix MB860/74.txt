I did a lot of research before purchasing this Motorola Atrix phone.  It had all of the features I was looking for.  Unfortunately, I jhad to return it because after trying for 2 weeks...alomg with tech assistance from Motorola, I was unable to connect with Motorblur which is required to use all of the phone features.
