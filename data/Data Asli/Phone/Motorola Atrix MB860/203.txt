This is my fourth android phone in last year, one for my cousin, one for me, one for my wife, and actually purchased this one for a friend of mine. The phone works perfectly. Faster than the desire, wildfire and motorola droid 2. The dual core from Nvidia is excellent at running everything. And the phone works great in Latin America (Venezuela) and Caribbean islands as well. There is a lot of bloatware installed by Motorola, that lives on top of the native Android OS, but this has very little lag or delay (despite other user reviews on Youtube). The cpu, ram, memory and visuals, and the screen colors are excellent. I would recommend this phone to anyone, and if the price drops further I will be purchasing another one in this line before Xmas. Android is better than iOS in my opinion (no disrespect, R.I.P. to Mr. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, who passed away 05Oct11). Take it from a real power user like myself, this phone will not disappoint. And with Google buying over Motorola, I am sure that we will see better products from 'M' in 2012.
