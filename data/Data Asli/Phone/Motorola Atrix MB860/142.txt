Well, this cellphone used to be the most powerful for a while, nowadays is just another one in the shelves. The product I got was defective, but the seller was kind enough to replace it. The new one worked correctly, but after 2 months, it is now giving me more trouble than the previous device. I have problems with the screen, there are dead zones. If I turn wifi or bluetooth it will reboot after 2-3 minutes. It also overheats quite easily. I now know this is a common issue in the Atrix 4G. If you can, try other newer device. I am sure the problems I am facing are because the device is quite old now.
