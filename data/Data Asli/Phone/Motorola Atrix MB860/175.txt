I did a lot of research before ordering this phone. The most important things being GSM unlocked (for business travel) and internal storage. It does not have the largest touchscreen and it is a little bit dated but the duel core processor and screen resolution make up for that - besides it is gorilla glass.The only thing disappointing at the moment is Motoblur - what idiot at Motorola thought this was a good idea I do not know. I was forced to sign up for an account and every time I change the sim I had to sign in again - it is really annoying. The only way to remove this God-forsaken blight on an otherwise brilliant piece of hardware is using a custom rom, so I am waiting to see if Cyanogenmod stabilises enough to give it a try.
