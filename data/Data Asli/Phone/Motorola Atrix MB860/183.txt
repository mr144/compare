It does not seem like this phone is origional. Seems like a high quality replica that is made in China. I worked for Motorola Solustions not mobility and none of the phones we were ever issued said made in china.The phone does not have a fingerprint reader like advertised.The phone locks up every 10 seconds and the touch screen stops working. I have to lock then unlock the screen to continue.ENsure you can connect to wifi. You cant use the phone until it is registered with Motoblur.
