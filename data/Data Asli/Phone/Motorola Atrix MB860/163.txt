I had this phone since August. It took me a good 2 weeks to customize it to my satisfaction, mostly by using GO Launcher and etc. (GO is awesome!!) From day one I felt like it was a fight with this phone. Battery life is dismal. Daily reboots. The phone began to freeze on phone calls and camera gallery. I had to do a factory reset in January just to get phone function back.Finally I went back to Nokia and got the Lumia. No problems and easy to use since day one. Most of my apps from Android were on WP. See, yes you have access to more Android apps, but most are useless, and this dual core phone can not handle too many apps anyway. All this power and you can not really do much.But I do love the Atrix for one thing (well, two).The docks!!!!I have the car dock and with all my music on a 32g sd card I am happy. I use PowerAmp as my player (Motorola stock anything is useless). Great mp3 player!!! Great sound.I have the multimedia dock connected to my Tv and I can watch YouTube or surf the web or use my apps or use it as a clock or mini stereo. Very handy!! This is the true beauty of Atrix ownership. I do not use it as a phone anymore but can do everything thru Wi-Fi.I have a standard dock too for mini stereo at work and charging. Never take this phone anywhere without a charger. Or you will be sorry.So if you get an Atrix, make sure you get the docks!! They make the phone so worth it, amd the prices are super cheap now.
