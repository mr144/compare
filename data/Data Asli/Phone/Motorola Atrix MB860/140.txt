it is got almost everything:  fast processors, responsive touchscreen, high resolution, MS Exchange, nice camera... even a fingerprint sensor, which to my knowledge no other phone has.  Mine never locks up or fails and gets good reception.  It rarely drops calls.So you might be wondering why I only gave it 4 stars instead of five.  The reason:  the phone call quality is mediocre.  Callers say that I sound like I am in a bucket, unless I am on my bluetooth headset.  And it is pretty hard to hear my callers; I do not have bad hearing, but I do have to keep the volume up at 90% to 100% at all times.  Any lower is too soft, but that high it distorts.So overall it is a super-cool phone, but it does not have the most important aspect that I require in all phones:  good sound.  I am happy with it because I use all the other smartphone features much more than I talk on it.  And when I talk, it is usually with bluetooth.
