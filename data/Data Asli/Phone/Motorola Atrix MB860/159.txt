Just thought I had to write a review. Got my Atrix yesterday everything has been working great. The setup is really simple - just accept your way through it. Did not bother to read the manual or see the tutorial and I have figured out where everything is in a day so the interface is really intuitive - something I would expect more from an iphone or more expensive product. Colours and clarity are good - nice for viewing the web - even small text is very distinct. Speed is great everything loads really quickly (perhaps faster than the apple, not sure about Samsung). Sound is decent; have not tried media player yet. Also like the size - not too large.Super value for money.p.s. the phone does warm up, I suppose the price of the 1ghz processor
