This is my first cell phone which turns off out of the blue, in the middle of a call, game, you name it. For me it is ridiculous that you have to install a 'clean' version of the OS just to make it work.And, instead of delivering the Android 2.2 I got the 2.3.X which has been known as the root of all problems.I'll have to stick to this piece of... until I can upgrade it - or replace with an iPhone or windows phone.
