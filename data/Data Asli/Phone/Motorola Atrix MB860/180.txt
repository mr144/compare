This phone ships from Germany so be prepared for lots of bloatware and links from there.Phone arrived super fast and was no problem to set up.  Although this is not the latest model, I like it much better than my Iphone that it replaced (more control over how the phone is configured and what goes on it).  I rooted the device and removed the stuff I did not need; still no problems with the phone.Carrier is AT&T.
