It is unlocked. The manaul is in German. I downloaded an English version online. Some pre-installed applications are in German, too. I just deleted them.The size is just perfect. I personally think Atrix-2 is too large for a cell phone. I like the finger-print reader.Not a 1080p video recorder. It is in Atrix-2 though.Battery life is long enough to me. Sometimes it became hot when I turned on wifi, GPS and Bluetooth for a long time.It will not burn.No complain to the seller. Shipping is quick.
