I was very worried about this phone, i was reading and watching a bunch of reviews to make sure about my purchase, now that i have been tested my Atrix 4G 2 weeks ago, I can tell you guys...it is amazing, pretty nice features, Monster battery, i listen music and use the wi-fi at the same time and the battery response better that i thought..., the camera is not the best that i have seen, but meets my good expectations. Absolutely satisfied with my device!!! Ohh...by the way, I check the warranty in the website motorola.com, and is absolutely active!! No complaint at all.!!!
