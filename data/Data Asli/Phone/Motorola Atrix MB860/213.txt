I have only had this phone for two days and it is my very first touchscreen android phone. So far I absolutely love this phone. Everything is great.ProsAmazingly fast. The dual core processor works great. Sensitivity is standard. Since it is my first touchscreen phone, I was afraid of messing up while texting but the horizontal virtual keyboard makes texting pretty easy. Response is great as well. At first I had some complication connecting to my WiFi but after a router reboot, it worked fine. Video quality for the camcorder is great. I love watching YouTube videos when I am bored. Voice quality is sharp and crisp. Video and picture quality is great as promised. I like this phone set.The Biggest ConsThe biggest problem that I found about Motorola Atrix 4G is that it is a battery hogger. The battery life for this phone is terrible. It does not even last me one whole day completely even if I have almost all my background applications, my WiFi, and data turned off.Another major problem that I have to point out about this phone is that it heats up really fast and really hot. I found I Phone 4 providing a better battery performance than Atrix. I fear if this goes on, then I might have to return the phone set.Overall, it is a good phone. Efficient and effective. If only the battery life was longer, then I would not have any complains with this phone.
