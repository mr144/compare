this is my first smart phone. i like this phone, its fast, its attractive, its made of metal not cheap plastic. the software is not perfect but its close. its better than iphone because the screen is HUGE :) i would recommend this phone if you do not care about dual core phones but the future of phones is dual core tech. for a non-dual core phone this thing is amazing. :) it one of the best android devices out there....i am a vampire ;)
