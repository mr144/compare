Before purchasing, i searched extensively about smartphones and finally after much thought finalized Motorola Atrix 4G.It was unlocked as mentioned and came in ordinary box('Motorola' was written on the box). The delivery was fast.So far phone is working great and i am loving it. The only thing is that it will be better if they provide HEADPHONES with the box!
