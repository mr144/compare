Got this cellphone for my fiancee to replace a samsung Y, and have not been dissapointed; it is very fast and light, with a big screen (4.0) a good resolution, it has a very decent camara (5 MP); Only to thing to improve is the battery consumption, but after rooting it and unisntalling all AT&T bloatware it has improved a lot. Bought it unlcoked and usinng it currently in Colombia.
