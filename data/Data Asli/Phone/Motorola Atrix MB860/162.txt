I bought this phone for the speed from the dual-core processor, the reliability Motorola devices seem to have and the pocket able size - so far I have been very pleased on all counts.I work in construction and, when paired with a Zagg shield and commuter style Otterbox, I do not feel uneasy bringing the Atrix to work with me every day. I have dropped it quite a few times (never over 5 foot drops) and it has never come apart/restarted/cracked the screen.All of the applications and games I have thrown at it work flawelessly, no staggering or lags at all, whenver the phone starts to lag it is generally from a lack of signal. The Atrix also has no qualms about playing 720p video files which is a nice upgrade from my previous phone.I can usually get 1.5 days out of a charge, this varies depending on if I use the internet heavily or talk a lot.The camera is decent, it is not going to amaze given what else is on the market now - but it is a very competent camera nonetheless.One bad thing I can report on this phone is it will restart sometimes of its own accord. This is generally when you tap out the RAM by having too many apps running at a time or an app that gets stuck and has a memory leak.Things I like:-Responsive-Thin Design-Amount of apps that can be run at the same time-Media options (micro-HDMI port and media server options)-Good call volume-Decent battery life-Durable (construction is not easy on electronics)-Forward facing cam (great for video conferencing)Things I do not like:-Random Restarts-Position of unlock button (personal preference)-Camera shutter speed can lag at timesOverall I really have liked this phone. it is the best smartphone. Even though it is well over a year old, it keeps up very well and has yet to show its age. The Atrix is the perfect blend of what I look for in a phone and I tip my hat to Motorola to delivering one of the best phones I have ever owned.
