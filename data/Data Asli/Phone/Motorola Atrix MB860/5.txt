The phone is good with all the features, but its not sturdy. It works fine for the first year or so and then start having issues. I have been having problem with the Wifi which hasnt worked for past 1 year, and now the touch screen does not seem to respond. Need to restart every other min or so. Not worth the price. Very disappointed.
