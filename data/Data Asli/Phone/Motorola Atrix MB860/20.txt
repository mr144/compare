Good reach, great sound, awesome screen, lots of aps and features, slim profile that fits in my pocket well.  I have bounced it off a couple of parking lots with no damage but a couple little nicks on the case.  Some folks complain of the 'cheap case'.  it is made of an engineering plastic like polycarbonate that, though it will nick up a little, is actually very strong and quite light.My only con for this phone is that now, having it for a few months, I am completely dependent on the thing.  My whole life is in there!
