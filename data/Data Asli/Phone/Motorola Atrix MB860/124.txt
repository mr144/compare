This purchase has been a waste of time.First at all, I received this cellphone on a Generic box, with generic accesories rolling around.2nd: The received battery is not the correct one for this model (BH6X( 1800Mah). Instead, I received a BX5H which is only 1500Mah and smaller.And finally, this smartphone is crap, it shuts downs everytime it goes to iddle, has turned off at least 20 times in less than 2 hours.And By the way, mine was sold by Ross Electronics LTD, I'ill never buy anything else from that company. Thank U for my waste of time and money.Ordering a refund..
