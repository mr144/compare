I love this phone. At the price i paid, it is a superbuy. It works great. sometimes the speaker is not very clear. otherwise, it is a great phone.Bluetooth, wi-fi, camera, sharing, all the bells and whistles work great. and yes, the android processor is excellent too.i would recommend this phone to anyone.
