I had a Samsung Captivate before. Not a bad phone, great screen but was a little slow. So I got the atrix, one for me and one for the wife. This phone is a hidden gem fast dual core phone and just the right size for the hand. You almost cannot believe that the phone has a 4 screen; larger than the iPhone 4 and 4S screen. I happen to have a iPhone 4. The phones were delivered on time and in in the new condition expected. Good stuff I like it. I would recommend it to anyone.
