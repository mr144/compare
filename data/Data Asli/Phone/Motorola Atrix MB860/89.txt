This is the worst phone I have owned and I have been using cell phones since 1998. It will not pick up a signal unless you are withing 300 feet of a tower. It has the weakest radio I have ever encountered in any cell phone.I do not recommend this unless you like being mad at your phone all the time.Going back to my Torch 9800 when I get my new SIM since the Atrix formatted it so it will not work in any other phone any more.Avoid if you value sanity and piece of mind. In an emergency you could always use it to start a small fire to warm your hands.
