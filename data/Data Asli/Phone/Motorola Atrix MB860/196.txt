I got this phone before android 2.3.7 came out... so i had to download that update.. Texting is fine but you will want to download gingerbread keyboard. If I did not need to have the immense storage capacity on it for when i travel overseas, i did have bought something else. Also the Android app killer wont kill your browser you have to go into manage apps and force close to stop the browser from killing your battery.WASTE OF $600. Buy one of the more popular DROID phones. You do not want this.In hindsight, I had a AT&T Sharp FX (Flo TV) phone before this. I paid over $150 for that phone brand new. SIX MONTHS LATER AT&T MADE THEM A NEW CONTRACT FREE PHONE. My Sharp FX is only worth $12 now. So lets make this an intelligent thought. $12 x 100% = 1200/$150 = 8%... My Sharp FX is worth 8 percent of its original value. So in one year my Motorola Atrix MIGHT be worth only 8 percent of its original value... so $48. NOT WORTH BUYING.UPDATE 14 September 2012.Had this phone for about a year. It was in the otter box the other week when I dropped it. The screen shattered. I took it to AT&T and the phone replacement is $125 so im just going to wait for my upgrade because that will be cheaper than replacing this piece of crap. Now the charger port has gotten loose and the phone will not charge overnight. Now that it isnt holding a charge it also died, and wont charge up again. it just sits there blinking the green light at me. About 3 months ago it also started corrupting the SD card.BUY AN IPHONE!
