I love this unlocked android. learning curve on its features is about 2 weeks for me as a novice to its touch/swype features. Otherwiwe it is quite easy to navigate. wireless connectivity is great in US but when going to other countries, updating your social networking and emails may be problematic - in which case, just resort to wired networks. But all in all, it is quite versatile, powerful and portable for documents on the go including presentations. The apps are cheap too but not all apps install easily. Synch feature with PC - not so user friendly. Wired or wireless, one must be able to manage the android apps from the celfon when connected to a PC. It only synchs with data. Not a big concern for me though as long as I can access my social networks via wired connection. Unlocked phone is expensive but worth it if you travel abroad.
