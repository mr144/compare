Is a very good Android phone by a reasonable price. If (like me) you do not need the state of art (the top technology with the last Android version, and a mini computer which make calls), this would be an excellent option of smartphone. Enough fast, a lot of apps capable, compact (some other models are so big that looks like you talk with a laptop in your ear). good hardware.The only one thing against: It comes with TIM (Italian phone carrier) boot animation and 5 not erasable TIM apps. but, what does it matter? the boot animation is changable, configure the phone with your local carrier settings is too easy, and the 5 TIM app icons...  I just ignore it. And, who knows...  maybe some day I could travel to Italy.
