This is a decent phone. I got the white one.Some high lights:Pros:- Screen size is 3.8'. It has multi-touch and screen detailing is crisp. Phone has a compact size.- Run smoothly on decent specs with dual core 800 MHz processor and 4 Gigs of internal memory. (a bit below the 1GHz on some high end phones with this same processor so this phone is probably underclocked for better battery life).- The phone has 768MB of RAM. (a bit below the 1GB on some high end phones).- Front-facing camera for video conferencing!! This gives the ability to skype or video-gtalk. Also gives the ability to add a face unlock app which is really nice.- Mobile Hotstop for tethering; WiFi Direct.- 1500 mAh battery with very good life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use - I get 30 to 40 hours on a single charge.- microSDHC up to 32 GBCons:- Gingerbread 2.3.6 (Would have liked to see ICS 4.0x on the newer phones coming out this year, I have seen only one reference to possible Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0x upgrade)- Maybe the price is a tad high @ $290 and a lower price of $250 would be more competitive.- Camera could be snappier. Hopefully an update would take care of this.Network: Update 12/04/2012- 2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900- 3G Network:GT I8160 - 900/2100 MHz BandsGT I8160L - 850/1900 MHz BandsNote:Amazon list the phone as GT-I8160 but there are actually two models of this phone which have different 3g bands. I ordered the GT I8160 from Open Group Wireless. Check with the vendor for the model number before you order.Overall:This is a nice phone with internal specs just below some of the high end phones.
