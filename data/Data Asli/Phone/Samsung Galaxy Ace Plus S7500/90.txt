To begin with, this is a very sleek phone with an easy to grasp operating system. The phone itself is light but seems sturdy and well-built.  Button placement is logical with crisp actions.  However, performing operations beyond dialing on this phone is tedious.  If you have ever owned an old computer on which you installed the latest operating system, you know what I mean.  Having more than one user application open at any given time noticeably slows the entire system.  Make the mistake of using two or more relatively tame applications at the same time and you are likely to freeze the entire system.  I put most of the blame on how Android treats background operations, but the phone hardware is equally liable.Skip this phone and get an older iPhone or perhaps the Galaxy S2.
