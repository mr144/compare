The shipping speed is very very slow. Nearly half month.  I gave many calls to ask them where is my order. &#34;tomorrow tomorrow&#34;the result tell me that I can not believe them again.2.It said a 4GB phone, but actually the system just available 800 Mb free space. And the usb space just have 1 GB.I sent e-mail to the seller, he told me that the operate system itself takes up much space.  Take more than 3GB space?! It's a joke! Not honesty.
