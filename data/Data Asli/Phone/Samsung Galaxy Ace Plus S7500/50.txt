Decided to switch from BB to Android and the Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus was well recommended from the reviews I read for the budget I was working with. HassleFreeCell had it new & unlocked for what may have been a Black Friday special price, and it was delivered way before the estimated date. The specs on this device as well as the fact that Samsung has it on the list to be upgradable to the Ice Cream Sandwich OS sealed my decision (it comes with the Gingerbread OS). The size is just right, the display and audio are great for videos/movies/music, and not having a hard keyboard on my smartphone is not as bad as I thought, having being used to Blackberrys for the past 5 years. I am definitely happy with this purchase.
