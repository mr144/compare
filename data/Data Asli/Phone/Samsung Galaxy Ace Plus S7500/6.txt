Just got this international phone and I live in dallas TX, and it works fine on solavei/t-mobile service. From what I gather is, however, being an international version, it is not compatible with 3G/4G networks in the US. So it is simply a 2G phone. But when I have the wifi (at home, work and other places that provide wifi) turned on it is faster than my previous 3G LG phone.
