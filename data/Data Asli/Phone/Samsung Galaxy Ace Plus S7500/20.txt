I bought this cell phone and the first thing I noticed was that it came set in a strange language (Ukrainian I think), and it was imposible to change it if you do not know the language! Thanks to my husband (who has a similar Samsung cell phone) he was able to set the language to Spanish. But please, I know it is an international version, but I do not understand why the seller was not able to change the language to English?Also, the cell phone came with an European charger and a cheap adapter that broke inmediately after trying to connect the charger. Too bad...The cell phones also freezes and restarts very often, mainly when it is connected to a wi-fi and the wi-fi dissapears and also when it needs to update some of the Android Apps. it is really annoying!If you are from Venezuela and you are planning to buy this phone, keep in mind that it can work with Digitel, but it will not work with 3G.Also, the seller says it is dark blue, but it comes in black.Why I did not return it? Because it is a pain to return the money to your credit card if you live in Venezuela (a long, long story, and I will not bother you with that).
