i like this telephone very much if you want an inexpensive smartphone able to make calls, store some photos and connect to the internet. its not an iphone, its not a gallaxy sIII but also its not the same price. the relation what you pay and what you get is excelent. The only problem being the lack of accesories like covers and protectors
