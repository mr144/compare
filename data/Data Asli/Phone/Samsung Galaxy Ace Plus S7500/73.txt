I bought this phone thinking what a great deal for a mid-range smartphone and then found out that it would not support the 3G from T-mobile.  T-Mobile uses the 1700/2100 mhz frequency for their 3G network.  You need the phone to support BOTH frequency in order to get 3G.  Maybe AT&T supports the frequencies on this phone.  Check with carrier before buying!  I had to return this and get a different phone.  Also, if you want the NFC enabled phone, make sure to get the i8160P version.  P=NFC...no P means no NFC.  Hope this helps!
