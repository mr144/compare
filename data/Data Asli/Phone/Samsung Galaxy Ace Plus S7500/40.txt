The cell phone's size is fit to my style. It is not too large or too small for average people. It meets my requirements for GPS map, Browser, E-mails. It runs smootly and very good in response. It is quick in start up, has a lot of internal memory for apps. Single core 1GHz processor is pretty good for a mobile device like this.
