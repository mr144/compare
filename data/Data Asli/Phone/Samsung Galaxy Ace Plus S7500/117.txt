Did not want the bigger Galaxy S, S2 or S3 so got this instead. Decent so far, the only quirk which can be annoying is whenever you complete a call there is a delay of 15 seconds before you get back signal to make another, even after updating the OS. The drop in signal was a provider issue. The only thing this phone needed was the capability of the S3 without the size.
