Package included: Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus Cell Phone (International Version - Unlocked), White Earphones, Mini-USB to USB Cable and Quick Start Guides (English & Spanish). This is my second smartphone (also bought in Amazon) and it is working fine with Movistar's network EDGE/3G (Ecuador, South America). Definitely, Android is an upgrade over the Blackberry OS. PROS: I am pleased so far with: Android OS, 1Ghz Processor, 3GB Internal Storage, 5.0 MP Camera and Google Play Store.I am really satisfied with the Google's sync capabilities. I use a couple gmail accounts and I browse with Google Chrome in my PC, so I can sync everything on the cloud (e-mail, calendar, contacts, documents, maps, etc). In other words,  I can access  my info anywhere and anytime.CONS: I think the antenna signal could have a better reception. maybe it is the 3G network... Samsung's accesories build quality feel kind of cheap compared to Blackberry accesories. Also, I could not find enough accesories in Ecuador, you better buy those in Amazon.I fully recommend this seller (BLUTEKUSA). They delivered it as advertised and fast ;)
