I bought this phone nearly 3 months ago and so far I am pretty satisfied with its quality and features it provides.  According to Samsung's announcement it should be updated with Android Jelly Bean in April. Overall it provides all basic smartphone features with reasonably low price. I had read almost all reviews and comments about all smartphones in this category and with similar features before buying Galaxy Ace 2. Two main competitor in this category with similar prices were HTC One V and Galaxy Ace 2. I chose Ace 2 because in most of the review articles about HTC One V authors show low battery life as main con of HTC. However battery life of Ace 2 as I expected is about 1-1.5 day, with less usage it can take up to 2 days. Besides Galaxy Ace 2 provides extra batter in its package box. Anyway it is highly recommended for those who are looking for a entry level and low priced smartphone having all basic popular smartphone features.
