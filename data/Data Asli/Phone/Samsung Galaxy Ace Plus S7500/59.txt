This product is all it is advertised.  I received it from Amazon prior to the expected arrival date in new condition.  It was in an unlocked condition so I can use it on any GSM network.  This is my first Android smartphone and so far it does everything I desire from a cellphone.  The screen resolution is good and the screen size, while only 3.65 inches is adequate for doing Emails and online websites. The phone size is perfect, not too big and not too small.  The 1Ghz processor speed is very fast also compared to the Nokia C6 I had before.  Samsung did an automatic update of the software (2.3 Gingerbread) the first time I went to their website. Calls are clear and texting is ok, though somewhat slow due to the small size of the screen and my large hands. I got spoiled using the slideout keyboard on the Nokia (unfortunately it broke after 18 months).  The 5mp camera takes great pictures.  A great phone and I highly recommend it for the price ($240) and quality.
