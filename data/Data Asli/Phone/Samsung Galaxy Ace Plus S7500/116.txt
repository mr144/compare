I really like this phone. So far it has not given me any troubles. It works perfectly with DIGITEL in Venezuela.The cons I actually see on the phone are:1.- The camera is pretty slow. it takes too long to take the shot and you have probably lost the moment you wanted to capture, plus there's no zoom.2.- The notifications do not appear when you are playing a game. for example: when I am playing song pop, the phone rings but does not show the notification.3.- The alarm clock is a bit complicated. You need to go into the clock, then go to alarm clock , then go to alarm and THEN create the alarm. I think it could be way more simple if there was a direct acces to the alarm clock, but you can not create it.4.- The front camera could have better resolution.5.- the LED light does not blink. Weird because a friend of mine has the GALAXY S II and hers does not blink either, so it seems more of a GALAXY issue.But despite of those things, I think this phone is great. It's all about getting used to the phone and I am very happy with it.
