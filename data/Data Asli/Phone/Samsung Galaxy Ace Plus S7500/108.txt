I really do not like the phone: worst size (I hate the trend to bigger and bigger screens like the Note2), slow performance, did nearly everything as expected.... but mine had one BIG flaw:When I lost the carrier signal the phone did not reconnect: so it happened a few times that my phone was sitting on my desk for half a day without a connection (until I checked it) and after restart I had 5 messages on my mailbox.Do not know if this was a hardware issue on my phone or a general issue on the phone, but I am sending my phone back.
