This is a nice phone with great features. The only problem I have is that at times I stop receiving calls and texts. When I realize it, I try to make a phone call but the phone shows me a message saying  amobile network not available'. When that happens, I have to turn it off and turn it back on so I start receiving calls and texts again.
