I bought this item from MobileCityOnline. Before buying, i contacted them to be sure that the model offered (GT-I8160L) was compatible with my operator's 3G data service and it was!. Please beware that there are two models for the Ace 2 where the only difference is the 3G band compatibility.Model ------- 3G Bands supportGT-I8160 ---- 900/2100 MHz (Digitel in Venezuela for example. Most operators in Europe use these bands).GT-I8160L --- 850/1900 MHz (AT&T in USA, Movilnet/Movistar in Venezuela for example. Most operators in the american continent use these bands).At first blush the phone seems to perform great. Nice screen and resolution, android gingerbread (ICS comming soon) and vga front camera.  Worth spending US$ 20-30 more in comparison to the ace and ace plus. Despite the price difference, the phone is still at a good price considering the specs provided.You can not go wrong with this phone.
