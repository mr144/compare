It was very easy to start using this new smartphone cause everything was synchronized perfectly although the original language was something I did not recognized. I could get my contacts, settings and everything back from my previous galaxy that got bricked. The battery duration is the only thing I can not be satisfied. The seller is highly recommended doe I have some trouble with delivery and send the product back to them, but we they manage to send it back to another address.
