I bought this unlocked phone - international thinking that I can use it in my country Peru. I was wrong. I did not know that 3g phones needed certain band width to work. OK, it is my fault for not cheking the specs. But as an average user, I did not know that  3g hdsm 900/2100 band is not compatible with 850/1900 band in Peru. Now know it, too late........ I have spent $ 220 for a phone that can be used with voice and 2g...... not 3g. A waste of money
