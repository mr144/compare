This phone was apparently manufactured for Telstra in Australia, and they must have locked down a bunch of functionality.  I tried to set this phone up for use in Israel, and there was no way to update for Hebrew support.  Also, was absolutely unable to upgrade from Gingerbread to Jellybean OS.  Do not buy if you want to use this with another language outside of the US.
