I purchased this smarphone, believing in what he says the product description says it has 3G Network HSDPA bands 850/1900MHz, which is my surprise to receive the package, this versiion, the S7500 brings 3G bands 900/2100 Mhz :-(.I had to buy another line, with another operator to use the smarphone, this product is poorly exposed in the description.
