This is my first smartphone and I have had it for a couple of days only, so I have not fully used the android applications available. The touch screen has good response. There are apps for Google Gmail, Google Talk, Youtube, Map, Google+, Voice Talk, Talk, Yahoo mail , News & weather, voice recorder, camera, voice command, FM Radio, Navigation, music hub, social hub, gallery,calendar, internet, google search, downloads, photo editor, messenger, Task Manager, Samsung Apps that provides a lot of options to download more apps etc.... The calls are loud and clear and I could check my emails via Wifi without needing a data SIM card. Yahoo mail looked better in the android phone as it showed attached images in small preview in the inbox view. The cell phone also downloaded some SW patches and applied after Wifi was setup. The GPS is good, have not tried the navigation feature. The Camera does not have a Zoom feature. Hoping to use the talk app to make free calls over free wifi (home, airport etc)
