Compare to the price the device is a perfect android device. It does let you do everything you would like to do in a smart phone. And the droid is fast enough to make you happy. If there was a front facing camera it would have been magical but look at the price. It will not allow you to get one with the price at least not today. Quality of the product is great. I would recommend the device for smart phone users.
