I have had this phone for about half a year now and I do not intend to change it. It's a good size (I do not like my phone being too big), light, fast and versatile. The battery holds charge for a day or two depending on how much I use it and I do a lot of browsing (over wi fi), email and facebook. The camera is solid (for a phone camera) and the sound quality is really good, both during conversation and music reproduction (I listen to the built in FM radio and MP3s fairly often). The only thing I do not like about it is that it tries to synchronize everything by default, i.e., it wants to merge my phone contacts with my gmail, facebook & skype contacts (oh, the skype app works great on it and the, albeit lower quality, front camera is great for it) which I do not care for (call me old fashioned, but I like to keep my contacts separate). Overall, I am really satisfied with my purchase since I got a lot of features for a lot less money than if I did bought something like an iPhone or a Galaxy SIII. I have also successfully used it in the US (on T Mobile & currently AT&T) as well as on various networks in Europe.
