I bought this phone because I needed a smart phone but could not afford a high end GS3.I like its features for the price. Decent memory, ram, dual core processor, all of which works pretty well. While the phone may not be butter smooth like a high end model, it offers many of the same functionalities.A weak point for me with this model is the internal memory. While it is 4GB, most of this is taken up by the OS, leaving only a little over 1GB for storage. A problem arises as you start loading up apps. You quickly run out of space, and apparently (I have checked forums) even if you select the external memory card data is stored in the USB storage. Go figure.Other than this, the phone is pretty solid and I would recommend this purchase if you are not looking for the same features as a high end smart phone.
