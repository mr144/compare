The phone was delivered as described, was quick and effective. It's in perfect condition and fully functional, no problems to activate with the operator. I am quite pleased with this cell phone because it has many improvements over version S5830 (ACE), in terms of speed (since it is dual core), ergonomics, screen and graphics, also has more storage memory for applications (rather negative aspect in the ACE version). I like a lot the performance of this phone regarding this range and price, and compared to other brands of the same range (like Sony Xperia Miro) is excellent. His design is very attractive and has some similarity to the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini (Samsung Galaxy I8190) and is a bit thinner than the ACE. I have to confess something I did not like, is that the camera shutter to capture photos is quite delayed, however the image quality is very good. Another negative thing is that the phone did not come with a Micro SD card, maybe no longer manufactures are coming as well. In general terms it is very good phone for the price it handles, has usually what you need and performs quite well.
