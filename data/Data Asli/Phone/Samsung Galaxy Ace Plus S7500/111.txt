I choose a 4 rating as the phone i s not perfect but for the price and a low to mid range phone i am satisfied..i would like to get my Wi-Fi set up as i have a few difficulty getting this going ...however it may be my set-up. sometimes some features/apps turn on and off by themselvesI like the host of features this phone gives...it is a very cute product ..not too big and not too small. while playing music for hours battery life is good.....however i turned off the wi-fi and some additional apps off as it continually search and kills the battery....I definitely would recommend this phone as it give you exactly what you pay for.....also great as a no-contract phone, big deal here...cuts down on the huge monthly phone bills.
