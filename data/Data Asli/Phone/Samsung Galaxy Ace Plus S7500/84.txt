This is my first smart phone.. I was hesitant because it is an unknown model here in the states, but in Latin America, where I travel a lot, it is a very popular model.  I am very pleased, but keep in mind that here in the states you wont be able to find a good assortment of cases for this model.  I bought a bright green one (so I would not lose it).. here on Amazon that fits perfectly, no problems.  I have been using the phone now for a couple of months and no problems other than it loses my network once in a while, which requires removing the battery and sim, and reinstalling. But for me that is par for the course with restarting electronics when they get confused so I do not mind.  Great phone at a great price.
