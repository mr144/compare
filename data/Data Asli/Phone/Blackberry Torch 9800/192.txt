I have had the Torch for like 6 weeks now. It was the first real 'smartphone' I had and I spent like a week just trying to sync my email and Facebook with it and figure out how to use it and not break it. It's really snazzy, but a bit heavy. The camera quality is awesome; I do not even use my digital camera anymore. There are a few really annoying things. First of all, when you are on a call the screen is prone to turn itself on and your ear or cheek will hit numbers or the mute button, which is so annoying, and can really screw you up if you are driving (even though I know you are not supposed to, you know you drive and talk).Then there's a sort of lag and delay when using the touch screen. That did not occur until recently.Lastly, the QWERTY keyboard is pretty small, and although I prefer it over the touch screen, I have long nails and often hit the wrong button. It is nice, however, to have the option of touch screen or slide-out QWERTY.At first, it lasted two days on a full charge. Now I charge it every night for safety because it started dying halfway into the second day.I do not want to rag on it, because it really is a nice phone, but it is just not as practical as I did like. In the future, I may invest in an iPod Touch, and, in conjunction with a crappy pragmatic flip phone, I'll be able to do the things I need to do without all the crap I do not need.
