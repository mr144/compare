bought this phone about 3mths ago...from the first week when phone is completely discharged the phone shows a battery icon on the screen with an x on it and refuses to charge...when i finally got fed up the phone started charging on its own after a few hours....phone does not ever charge fully...if it did not cost so much to ship it back as i am using it in trinidad and tobago i did send the darn thing back!
