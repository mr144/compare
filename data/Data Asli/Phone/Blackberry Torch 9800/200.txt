For three years I carried two phones: my work BlackBerry and the iPhone my wife bought me. For years I waited for a smartphone that combined with the use-ability of the iphone but with a keypad so that I could bust out work emails with the speed of light without making a 100 typos. I wanted to carry only one phone and I thought the BlackBerry Torch was the answer. Instead, I want to light this MF on fire. The Torch is a once, non-intuitive and non-imaginative. It's clunky. It's like the developers never even picked up the iphone when they developed this latest 'iPhone Killer.' Let me tell you, if the Torch is an iPhone killer, then Roberto Duran was the Sugar Ray Leonard killer. No Mas! I am taking this steaming piece of doggie doo back to AT&T and unwinding this 5 hour transaction with extreme prejudice. But if you want a real critique, here is a short list: the web browser is awful; the touch pad typing is horrendous; the map sucks; why can not I add a number to existing contacts?!?; they make you agree to a contract on every application that you open . . .if I were going to spend 48 hours with this phone, I am sure that I could find 50 things I hate about it. And to the two people who had iPhones and advised me to buy the Torch like they did: get off of the Crack(berry)! And did I mention that I hate this phone? I did rather go back to my 3Gs with it is cracked screen and my blackberry bold. Oy vey.
