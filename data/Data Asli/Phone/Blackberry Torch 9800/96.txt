I bought an unlocked Blackberry Torch 9800 with an international warranty. It has not even been one year and the the phone is broken! The screen does not work, it is completely blank. Not to mention the screen used to freeze occasionally when the phone was actually working. Since my phone is unlocked my carrier refuses to repair or replace it. I called Blackberry's customer service and apparently they will not honor my warranty either. Horrible customer service! DO NOT BUY BLACKBERRY PRODUCTS IF YOU WANT TO SAVE MONEY!!
