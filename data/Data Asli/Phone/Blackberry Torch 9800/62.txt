when i received this phone it looked in very good condition, but it did not come with a CD and there was something wrong with the speaker, i could not listen to the ring tone and i could not listen to music. it worked one time only then it went back to not working and it stayed like that, and this was 2-3 hours from when i received the phone. very very very disappointed, i am going to travel in 3 days and i do not have time to purchase a different phone. i went to ATT and Verizon Stores trying to buy this phone but they did not have it. so i am going to have to buy one from where i am going to be traveling to.......i put it back in the box and i shipped it back to the seller the same day, the phone was not new even though i paid for a new phone, it was refurbished. it was a bad experience never again. i think Amazon should be more strict with these kind of sellers, they really put me in a tough situation now.......
