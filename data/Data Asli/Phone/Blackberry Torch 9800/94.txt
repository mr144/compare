BEWARE!!I purchased this phone supposedly brand new and unlocked supplied and shipped from AMAZON. I received a new box with the seal unbroken. HOWEVER, When I opened the box, though the phone seemed untouched... it came with NO BACK DOOR battery cover. Added to which, I could not sign in to Windows Live Messenger or GTalk, it would display an error message 'The application has been disabled from IT Policy!' and 'Windows live messenger has been blocked!'... but BBM worked fine. When I contacted my local service provider, they said there is nothing on their side that they can do.I contacted RIM for their assistance, who subsequently informed me that the settings for the enterprise network the phone was previous connected to still exists on the phone, and that's why I am having the problem. So of course I am confused... I paid for a BRAND NEW PHONE, but RIM reveals the phone was actually in use before.So my advice to you is when purchasing phones online... proceed with caution!
