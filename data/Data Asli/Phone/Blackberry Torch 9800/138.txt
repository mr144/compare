I bought this phone about 2 months ago, I have not had time to write a review as I am always traveling but they sold me something new as something used, this blackberry came with a problem I could only listen from one of the ear plugs and the light on front will never go off, it is very disapointing that you buy something as new and it turns out to be an used , refurnished product, I will never buy from this company never again.
