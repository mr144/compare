The phone was used, there was a screen saver already on the product that was scratched and dented. The data on the phone had been wiped clean, meaning I am now unable to get and set up my email accounts on the phone.  The phones slide was also damaged and is pulling away from the phone causing it to be uneasy to open and close. The phone also requires to be rebooted often due to unexpected errors. This product was not new had been used and should not be sold to anyone else. I would never recommend this product to another person due to the problems that I have been having. Thank you.
