I am very please with this phone thus far.  The WiFi feature works nice even if you do not have a data plan.  Recently added a data plan and that seems to work nicely too.  Streaming video from ESPN, CNN, and others seems to work nice although the picture quality is about a 7 out of 10.  Really a non issue for me because I primarily want the phone to make calls, text, music, back up GPS, then streaming videos.  Word to the wise is that you'll have a hard time getting the GPS to work on the phone without a data plan.  I found one app (Mobile GMaps) that works with WiFi and gives the option to store maps on your phone but i never tried the saving maps to the phone feature out.  So, if you want a phone primarily for business use (phone calls, texting, emails) as well as good / decent entertainment than I highly recommend this phone.
