Received the phone, and it was just gorgeous! The only issue I have had with it, is that allllll of the materials enclosed with it were in Spanish and I could not read any of it! This is my first Blackberry, and I really just love it! I have found that it is super easy to use, screen is easy to read, and I love having both the full qwerty keyboard and the touch keyboard. There is not a bad thing I could say about it! Particularly coming from a VERY basic mobile before it, I have found it is so easy to use and navigate (especially considering that I could not read any of the materials that came with it!). Pictures have turned out REALLY well.  The only issue I have had using the camera portion is more user error (shaky hands!).
