I bought the phone to be used in India and so far it has been a good phone and works as expected. Below are pros and cons in my opinionPros1. Good looking and sturdy feel.2. It has the most recent blackberry OS which is a bit more user friendly and intuitive than the previous version3. The touchscreen interface is similar to iPhone and much better than the BB stormCons1. The touch keyboard is not as reponsive as the iPhone. It may get better with more practice but atleast initially it feels a bit clumsier and tad too sensitive. The physical keyboard is good.2. The OS is still not as user friendly as the iPhone's iOS.3. The BB appworld is a joke compared to Apple. Also the fact there are multiple sources for downloading the apps takes some getting used to. Some of the apps such as Vonage and Skype are not available for blackberry torch. I hope this gets resolved soon.Overall, not a bad phone.
