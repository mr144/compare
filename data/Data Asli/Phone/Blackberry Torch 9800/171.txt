Well, I am a new BB user, always using Nokia, so I knew I could have some problems related to 'usability', but it has been not a ver hard learning curve.Pros:- Nice graphical interface (dual touch and things like that)- The keyboard works great- It has a concept where all the things are combined, like LinkedIn, Facebook, and the normal people directory- I have my business stuff there- Even it does not sound great, it plays music (with phones) decently- The internet navigation works very well- The camera works decently, but for me is not my main camera so I am fine with thatCons:- It could have a better screen resolution- The integrated speaker does not have a great bass, and they are not stereo (my previous phone was a Nokia Xpressmusic 5800, and its speaker sounded great to be a phone)- The screen, when unlocked, seems to be very sensitive- I though the Xpressmusic battery lasted too short, 2 or 3 days, but this one is drained in 1 to 1.5 days with normal use (two e-mail accounts + FB + LinkedIn + phone, all on line, having deactivated bluetooth and WiFi)As a closing line, I should say that is a great business phone, and a normal-use phone too.UPDATE: I suspect that the BB holster is the reason I have a  didecent' battery performance compared to others:[...]
