I already own a Torch, which continues to serve me well, so dispite the mixed reviews I ordered anyway.  Totally pissed off now.....this is a used phone.  It was cleaned up and re-wrapped, but a quick inspection clearly revealed signs of use.  This is a complete (and expensive) rip off, and after years of doing good business with Amazon, I am cannot understand why they would continue to fulfill this item despite multiple reviews indicating that the phones in this listing are not New, as advertised. This listing should have been removed..
