The touch screen it is very usefull, it makes the cellphone easier to navigate and it is built-in keyboard makes writting very fast if you do not like the touchscreen. I do not like that wi-fi can not be used separatelly from the data plan, it just make it faster. I rate the phone with 9 over 10 stars.
