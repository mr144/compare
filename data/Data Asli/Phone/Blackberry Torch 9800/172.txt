I was using a Bold before I switched to Torch.  Torch is a real disappointment.The cons:1. Hangs every now and then2. Responds very slowly esp after you slide the touch screen out3. Battery drains faster than other BBs4. Many apps available for Bold and other BBs are still not available for Torch5. Sometimes dials out going calls in the background (this is a nightmare!)Are there any pros:1. It has a touch screenAll in all, avoid changing your cell phone from some other BB - no matter which other BB you are using.  If you are not using any BB then switch to Bold.I hope you found the review helpful.
