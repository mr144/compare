I purchased this phone after the Milestone. I had dropped calls nonstop with the milestone and had a TON of issues with email. I bought this phone a few weeks ago and so far so good! Lots of fun apps and very easy to use. I LOVE the sliding keyboard, it is much easier to type on it. I am very happy with my purchase.
