I have not really tested the cell phone yet but the very first thing I noticed was that it clearly stated  are manufactured in the back... when it was sold to me as new! so far it is been working ok but it should be clear before actually purchasing it that this is a  aremanufactured' item.--Edit--The freaking charger does not work either!!! I am in Venezuela so I am pretty much stuck with what I already got but I strongly recommend not to purchase this item from OEM Shop, they are not running a serious business obviously!--Edit--The phone is now powering off every 10min by itself, this is quite a disappointment, usually you buy from Amazon cause they handle serious business, if I would have know this was going to happen I would have bought it from any other seller including ebay and probably save some money in the process--Edit--It finally happened... the phone powered off and will not turn on again, it is now in a tech service in my location (since I can really get the phone back to the US), they assure me that not only it is a refurbished phone but a used one! possible issues: flex or in the even worse situation the motherboard, I guess if I wanna keep the phone I'll have to pay it twice, I wanna make clear that I already had to change the charger--Edit--OEM Shop is taking back the phone for a full refund, the phone is on its way to their facilities, it is definitely not the best case scenario but at least they are taking responsibility for it and have been for the most part very welcoming and receptive about providing a solution
