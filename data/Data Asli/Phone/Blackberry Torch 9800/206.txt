I had this phone for over a month now, and here are just some thoughts about it.I enjoy reading online novels, and having this phone I am allow to sit in my car reading something while just chilling or waiting for someone.It works perfectly fine with some short stories. But when it goes to loading huge amount of texts (300,000 and up), it takes quite some time(maybe 3 or 4 minutes or even more) to just finish downloading the page, and then it will take another 2 minutes to adjust the format as you zoom in. And if you are not careful enough holding the device up tight and so happen to flip it just a bit (or maybe just taking a sip of a drink or a call), it will automatically change its viewing from straight to side and here goes another extra 2 minutes again.I do not know if iphone or android have the same problem; yet I am actually fine with waiting the initial 3 minutes of the loading part.But honestly, I think it should have some sort of applications to lock the viewing as you are surfing the internet.And sometimes, it does not happen very often, while you are surfing the internet, the page somehow freezes and the back of the device starts heating up. And within 1 or 2 minutes period, the battery life suddently drops about 30%. I kinda worry if this is goning to damage the device.The actual keyboard is awesome, but the touch screen keyboard is just retarded. You often typed in the letter below the one you actually typed.The camera does not have a tiny mirror next to it, so it is really hard for you to take a picture of yourself.The back cover became a bit lose after I accidently dropped it six inches height to the desk, but it is probably my own fault (however I still have not found the part that makes the cover lose).I think it is an ok device, and if rim fixes the touch screen keyboard and make some adjustments to the internet surfing, I did rate it as 4 stars.
