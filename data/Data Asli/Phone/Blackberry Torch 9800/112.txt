after buying this phone i'll never buy any cheap electronics's online anymore. From the first day i got this phone i had problems ..... i trusted most of the good reviews this seller had, but i ended up getting the wrong end of the stick. This phone keeps going on and off from the first time i got and now it do not even come on anymore.Now i have to try and see if i can fix it witch was not my intention.this is the first time i got a bad product from amazon.... wast of my $300.00 (if they had a -5 rate i would of selected it) Buyers do not let this price fool you like it did me.... i would never recommend this buy. on another note this seller is on my black list .... i do not trust him/her at all.
