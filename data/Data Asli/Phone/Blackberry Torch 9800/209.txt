I have that Van Morrison song going through my head. I love it -- the Blackberry Torch, that is. Elegant in design and function, a pleasure to use. The slightly recessed keyboard is easier to hold and type on than my old Curve. The touch screen and menus are intuitive and quick to learn. Got one for my wife, too. She's usually something of a technophobe, but she caught onto the Torch immediately. She especially likes the large screen, optical track pad, Google Maps and camera. I like the mail functions and WiFi plus 3G access. To my surprise, the web browser was even able to connect with a Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) site for one of my business accounts that I am otherwise unable to reach without a PC. I paired my phone with a Finiti Bluetooth headset, which works great. The only things missing were cases and mobile chargers, but you can find them cheap at Amazon.
