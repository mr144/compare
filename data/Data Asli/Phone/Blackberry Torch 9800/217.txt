I bought this phone after reading some positive reviews, after I had a little accident with my Nokia Nuron. I needed a new phone now and was very disappointed with the usability of the Nokia phone. The Blackberry, to make it short, is excellent: great build quality, nice physical keyboard, everything is just as big as it should be. Everything is usable. And unlike Nokia, it took me one day, not two weeks to figure out the basics of the phone. All-in-all, I can totally recommend this phone.Update after 3 weeks: Still love it, and I really love the physical keyboard. This phone is great, and is awesome for e-mail.My only negatives on this phone are the following:- I had the phone at 50% and wanted to just plug it into my laptop to power it up. I picked up the phone and the entire screen was black and totally dead. What ? Nothing worked to revive it ! Very, very disappointing.- The battery is EXTREMELY hard to remove ! I tried as hard as I cold with just my human hands, but even if my life had depended on it (thank God it did not !), I could not have gotten that battery out. I finally got home and used a very sturdy 'tactical' knife to pop out the battery. I seriously hope none of you needs to get the battery out of the case when you do not have a big knife handy !
