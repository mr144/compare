when i first search to buy this porduct, in this case was a blackberry torch 9800, i wondered if there was any seller that could sell this without any logo of the carrier for example: at&t and verizon. So if you do not want the logo in your smartphone this is the seller is a brand new porduct and not a refurbished one as in said so in some reviews. make sure youre buying form wireovia.
