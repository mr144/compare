I have had it for two months (Nov 2010) and really enjoyed the nice big screen and the slide out keyboard.  However, I do not think it is ready for prime time.There are numerous faults.  Touch sensitivity is sluggish, and multi-touch is almost non-existent.  I have spent more time trying to increase and decrease screen size than actually reading articles.The Apps store is pathetic.  Less than 1000 games, and you will not find any of the most popular games like Angry Birds.Battery life is about 16 hours on moderate use, and 6 hours on heavy use.I am glad I paid a penny for the phone on the 2 year plan, because that's all it is worth at this stage in the life cycle.  I'll stick with it for now, but most likely i'll migrate to an android phone next year.
