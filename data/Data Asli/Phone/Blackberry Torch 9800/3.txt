Bad, bad, bad. Totally disappointed with this product. It was not Blackberry's fault, it is the sellers fault. They advertise & sell refurbished phones as new. DO NOT DECIEVE CUSTOMERS LIKE THAT!!! Everything was wrong with this phone, programs were missing, emails could not be set up and the list goes on. Now I am very apprehensive to purchase another phone online.
