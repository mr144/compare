I have had this bbery torch for 2 wks now and I am so disappointed. In the beginning it worked fine but then after a week everything went downhill. The buttons do work anymore ie. the call, bb,clear, and end buttons none of those buttons are working.This is utter disgraceful!! This phone is suppose to be new! Now i am stuck with a phone that is of no use to me.
