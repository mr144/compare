I bought this reconditioned phone as a gift for my wife and received it in very good condition. Absolutely no sign of it being used, however the camera did not work. I was really disappointed about this because the information on the phone never said the camera was defective. I contacted the seller who informed me that I could return it and get a full refund but my wife had already got attached to it and the phone was a great deal. The seller graciously sent me a $25 gift certificate which i can use to offset the cost of repairing the defect. Apart from all that the phone works well and looks good too.
