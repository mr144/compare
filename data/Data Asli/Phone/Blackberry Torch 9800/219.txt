I have had all sorts of smartphones and was thinking about getting this touch version or an iphone. After the touch screen of my ipod crashed and became unusable, and further learned that this is a very common issue and that's why they keep releasing new versions, I decided to give BB torch a try. I was impressed with the short time it takes to boot on OS6, there's not much to learn on how to get a hold of the apps if you have owned a BB previously.I have seen some comments from people complaining that their phone is slow to respond. I guess that if you are in the middle of an installation and begin multitasking this could happen. But I have not been seeing any performance issues whatsoever and it is working smoothly and keeping me pleased with my purchase.For those of you planning to buy it unlocked, it worked with no issues with my local provider (and I was expecting lots of issues due to the poor quality of the service I get from my phone company).Do not think twice and get your hands on this BB.
