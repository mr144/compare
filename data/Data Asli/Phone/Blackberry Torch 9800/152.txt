First of all, I own an Iphone 4 and this Blackberry Torch.  I have to say that this Blackberry is all business.  The new OS is very streamlined and nice but you can really tell that it is a tool built for business.  Where my Iphone has no hope of connecting with a true enterprise communications system, Blackberry does so with ease.-The keyboard opens up like it is on spring loaded rails-The keyboard is easily the best keyboard I have used on a phone (it is a blackberry phone)-The case that you buy separately, puts the phone to sleep when you put the phone in it-There's a handy red light that tells you if you have a message, calendar entry, or missed phone call-The battery lasts and lasts-There's a 3.5mm headphone jack-There's a shortcut button on the side that you can customizeSo yes, you can play music, shop for applications like facebook, yahoo im, etc . . . but at the end of the day this is a business tool.Whereas my Iphone is all  amy life.'  which is nice.This torch though is sleek, streamlined, shiek, and nouvo without losing that 'all business' feel to it.  I carry both and I love both for different reasons.
