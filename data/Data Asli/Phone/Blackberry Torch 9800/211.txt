Here goes.  I bought this device because I love that it combined the full qwerty keyboard with a touchscreen.  I found out that not everything that glitters is gold.I love:Full keyboard, camera and display on this device.  It has a very smooth track to open the keyboard.  It's simply a perfect idea in its conception.I hate:It's slow and I mean slow on the processor end.  It takes some getting used to in order to delete multiple messages, but the WORST is that when I am on a call, the darn thing intermitently pushes numbers (like if your toddler was trying to get your attention and starting pushing the button on the phone to make them beep). It is worse than iphone, motorola, htc, iphone, nokia or even a google nexus phone. It also has put people on speaker phone while we are talking which is a big no-no for me.  Lastly, it hangs up while I am on a call, which is the worst insult of all.  And no, I do not have a fat cheek.I can not imagine that RIM's engineers and beta testers did not run into the problem.  At least with my IPhone, the screen goes black when you put it up to your ear so this does not happen.  I say back to the drawing board and I am sending this back.
