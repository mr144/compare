Hey OEM! Stop scamming people with used phones sold as new!!This is not cool, and Amazon's reputation is at stake.The phone showed signs of use even though it was packaged like a new phone,and there were songs from Notorious B.I.G (I am black, but not a fan),and Big L (Do not know him, do not care for him).Spending this much only to be duped is not acceptable.
