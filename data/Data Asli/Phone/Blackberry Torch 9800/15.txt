When I ordered this product it was said to be NEW. Unfortunaly the phone I received was not new. It did not look even like new. Scratches on some places. The sliders grooves  worned as in closed position the clearence is big. The battery in bad condition and hairs inside the phone. Because of my job ( always travelling )it was not possible to return the phone back. After two days the battery started to discharge quickly ( for few hours) and the phone became warm on its back side. Definitely some one did something as the screw bolts were with worn heads.Hopefully I did not buy something more expenssive this time like iphone 5 for example. I did not have  problems up to now with Amazone, but I think I'll quit my account due to sellers like this one. I'll recommend my friends and coleagues to do so and to be careful when buying from Amazon.
