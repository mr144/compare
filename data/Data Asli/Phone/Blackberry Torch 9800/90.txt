phones looked good to me but three days ago one of them started to fail, the trackpad move away alone, when I take it for service for my 'not so surprising' the phone did not have their original seals on screws, the phone had been previously opened and all decals altered in the back. Then i take the other for safety for review is also and both were in the same situation.Really I do not trust Amazon for buy BlackBerry phones, it is always the same, used or refurbished phones.
