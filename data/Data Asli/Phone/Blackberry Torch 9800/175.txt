I purchased my torch back in late Jan and loved it for the first 30 days.  Then odd things started going wrong and chalked it up as a learning curve or users error.  However, by the middle of March I knew something was going wonky.  Things started happening like sudden non response touch screen, the mute button going off during a call, slow response times, sudden shut downs, and the list goes on.I have a busy life and did not have the time to run it into the store but when one day the touch screen was totally unresponsive and did not 'wake back up'.  I went to the store, April 8.  Finally after two replacements under warranty I took the phone into the center only to watch another 7-10 Torch phones come in right after me with similar problems.They got it to work but only for around ten hours this last time!  So now after the third replacement is on its way I am switching to the Captivate.  AT&T did right by me, but it took four replacements and now it is May 11, so it took a month of phone issues to do.On another note the day after I bought mine I picked one up for my daughter and hers has been fine but... It is starting down the same path.  Ugh...  Not bad enough yet but every now and again she sees a major upset.
