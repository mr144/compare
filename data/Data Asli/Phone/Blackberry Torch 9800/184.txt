I have been through a couple 8220 Flips and a 9550 Storm 2 that I have owned and I have used a few Curves and Bolds and this is by far the best Blackberry, hands down. Trying to compare it to previous BB models is downright unfair as it blows the all out of the water. The touch screen is a huge improvement over the Storm 2 and its nice to see standard gestures like pinch to zoom are supported. The fact that it has the full querty keyboard and trackpad makes it an easy transition from non-touch phones and also makes it more efficient in general as a lot of operations feel more natural doing it the 'old-fashioned' way instead of touch-screen.The camera is much improved and BB OS6 is a huge improvement over previous versions. I love Social Feeds and how tightly the apps integrate with your contacts and the phone sofware in general. The new search feature is great too; just start typing and it brings results from contacts, emails, social feeds, applications, etc.So basically, as far as Blackberrys are concerned, you can not go wrong!Compared to other smartphones and mainly the iPhone4 you can tell that the touchscreen still has a ways to go before it reaches the same maturity as the others who have been doing this for longer.  Also, as far as apps go, its definitely lacking. There are very few good free apps and games and the games are just downright terrible compared to the amazing stuff that's coming out for iPhone.  That said, gaming probably is not a big priority if you want a Blackberry.All in all, I am very satisfied! I have been wanting this phone for over 6 months and watched tons of reviews and hyped the thing up so much and despite all of that I still managed to get surprised with this phone. It's awesome!Pros----+ Real touchscreen with all gestures+ Trackpad and QWERTY Keyboard = best of both worlds+ BB OS6 is great+ 5MP cameraCons----- Touch is a little awkward at times- Freezes/chokes for a few seconds occasionally- Lacking in app department- Crappy games
