Other then the problems to receive the product through belgium customs and the extra Euro 100,= charges for clearance, which is besides this point I guess, I love the BB Torch 9800, it is a great tool that assists with everything very efficiently, I am taking notes and make pictures all day with it, sync at work and home, write a lot of SMS and e-mails with it, it works really swift and smooth. Very handy and sharp tool, I like it.
