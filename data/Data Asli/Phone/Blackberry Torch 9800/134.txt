Do not buy this phone. I have never had so many problems with a phone. no zoom in this camera. It's OS is slow and lame. The apps for this phone are not worth a penny. I'll never buy a blackberry phone again. The battery life is a joke. I could not even make it a full day before recharging...it was only a several days old.  The main reason I brought the phone was for it is keyboard. I will not make that mistake again.  Blackberry torch 9800 is a sorry excuse for a smart phone.
