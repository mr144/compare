This is my second BB, the first one was a 8320 Curve. This is the best BB smartphone ever.Its a work horse phone. If you want a pleasure phone for messing around buy the Iphone4. For work buy this BB torch.1. Great resolution of the screen, Youtube videos looks great and is easy to read.2. Great idea having both the QWERTY keyboard (for long emails) and touch keyboard (for quickess short messages).3. I have four email accounts, I can see all of them on one screen.4. Unlocked Quad-Band GSM cell phone compatible with 850/900/1800/1900MHz frequencies and 3G HSDPA 850/1900/2100/800 plus GPRS/EDGE data capabilities.5. Touchscreen is as sensitive as the Iphone4.5. Excellent camera with flash, auto-focus and image stabilization, plus 11 photo modes.6. The battery life should get you through 1day and a half but is fast recharged.7. Excellent speaker volume to hear music.The only aspect that I do not like is the screen lock button its extremely sensitive to any physical contact.I really just love it!
