This phone does not support 3G or 4G on Tmobiles network. I contacted Tmobile and was told because the smartphone is set at a different frequency it cannot be supported. You can only get EDGE speeds or Wifi. This is not mentioned at all in the description only that it is unlocked and will work on 'any GSM' network.
