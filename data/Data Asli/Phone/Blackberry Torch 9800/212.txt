Hi people i have had this phone for a week and all can I say that's awsome, i am loving it, it is by first BB and now i can see why this kind of devices are one step ahead over the others phones. It's sleek and well constructed. Other phones seems a toy if you compare software. OS 6 is very easy and intuitive to navigate.I strongly recommend it !
