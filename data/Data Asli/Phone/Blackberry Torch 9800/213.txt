I had a Samsung Eternity that I liked, but I am not a big fan of just a touch screen.  I wanted a phone that had both.  I really like my Torch.  It's a bit heavier, but that does not bother me.  The only complaint I have with the touch screens are if you do not lock it, you end up dialing out or while on the phone your face can disconnect someone.  Otherwise, I would definetly recommend it.
