I would not recommend this phone to any person who does not work in the business field. First I would like to say that I see why the Blackberry Torch could be popular with it great abilities to manage and view stuff form the internet. My issue with the phone is its unnecessarily difficult to use OS which takes to long to navigate between windows. But my primary issue is the fact that my phone freezes every couple of minutes as im am texting a friend or using the internet forcing me to restart every time (I have only installed 5 apps that did not come with the phone and I have not used memory space for anything else). The lack of apps and the bad quality of the apps available from app world also bothers me a lot. As a first time Blackberry user I initially bought one thinking that it possibly match or out perform other platforms like Android os and Apple's ios based on how Blackberries are seen as phones with the highest and best quality. Well now I know that this is completely untrue and that I will never buy a Blackberry again unless they completely overhaul their terrible os.
