This phone is not for everyone!!! Besides having a fabulous camera, it is annoying! Oh and mine is currently not working!!! I brought this phone in MARCH 2011 and we are in July and I cannot get the phone to come on. This was after two weeks of the screen going blank ever so often and shutting down on it own! I am not sure if the phone is faulty from the Seller or factory. But I highly regret this purchase.
