...because I do not want RIM to die off.  The more competition, the better for the consumer, otherwise we are stuck with Google, Apple, and maybe Samsung.  I waited so long for RIM to make a 4G phone as I did not want to get stuck with another 2 year contract with old technology.  More than a year after its competitors, the Torch finally came out, and I jumped on it.  It started as a breath of fresh air, as coming from the Bold, the screen was beautiful, and I could actually make use of the internet on a halfway decent screen!  The Torch also looked the part of a good smart phone.Then I started using it! Here are the frustrations I encountered:-The battery would not keep a charge for a full day, even on standby, so I always had to have a charger with me!-The lock button is too easy to press, and I could not use my favorite Blackberry Holder, because I always need to touch the off button in order to pull it out of the holder to answer the phone.  I would then have to call back the person half the time.-The touchscreen includes a mute button and a speaker button.  It's really easy while on the phone to have one of those buttons be touched by my cheek, and most of the times I have lost the conversation while trying to 'unpush' them.  Extremely frustrating, and totally unacceptable.-If you are in the 'Contacts', and you want to make a phone call that is not within your contacts, you can pull up the touchscreen keyboard, but when you switch to numbers, those numbers are so tiny, that there is almost no way to touch them and not make a mistake.Terrible design, terrible phone.
