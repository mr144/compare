I bought the Torch with high expectations and assumed that RIM had finally got its act together and created a slick product.Unfortunately while the Torch has a fairly nice screen, OS 6 is disappointing and the phone has plenty of fatal flaws. Some examples:- Search finds hits but does not display the results!- Touch on a message, but the one below opens.- Easy to hit the wrong key, as a result I have plenty of accidental deletions- No easy shortcuts- Long menus that take a long time to navigate. Way too many clicks to get anywhere.- Options and settings are frustrating to use (even for a tech geek like me)- Browser is still pathetic compared with the competition- Ludicrously sensitive and inaccurate screen. Screen lock disengages in my pocket far too easily- No orientation lock and orientation sensor is not as good as the iPhoneI am a business user and many of the features are blocked, but even then the basics are not great. The simplest solution is to buy an iPhone. Iphone 3GS is nicer than Torch. Even the first version of the iPhone software beat OS 6.
