I live in southern america, and the product works perfectly with mi home and work WiFi's as well as my phone service provider.When inserting the SIM card, it took a few 20 to 30 minutes to carry out a suitable 'handshaking' process with the new PIN from my previous to the new Torch Blackberry, but other than that, it has been working flawlessly.
