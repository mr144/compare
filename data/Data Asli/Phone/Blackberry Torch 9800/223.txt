The Blackberry Torch is the best all-around business smartphone.  It emails better than the iPhone 4 because of the traditional Blackberry qwerty keyboard and it files and sorts emails like Outlook.  I can see all my email accounts on one screen and I can see my sent emails in the same screen.  This was something the iPhone 4 required going to two separate screens to see.  The HTC ARIA was even worse, had to go to each account and then switch from the inbox to sent folder.  This was a pain since I have 4 email accounts.Battery life on the Torch should get you through a full day, unless you are watching movies.  For an average day, I talk for an hour or two, email 20 - 30 times, listen to an hour of music and search the web for about 30 mins.  The HTC ARIA only lasted until 6pm.Screen resolution is good but not as nice as the iPhone 4.  The camera is pretty good and has custom settings.One major flaw is the oversensitive screen lock button - can be a pain when using the phone horizontally - inadvertent screen lock sucks.All in all, the Torch is a great phone.
