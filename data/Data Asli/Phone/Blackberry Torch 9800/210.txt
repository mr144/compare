I had used the same curve 8310 for 2-1/2 years. I could not bring myself to get an iPhone since it was just too 'play' for me. I saw the torch and knew I needed it. I can not possibly express how AWESOME this phone is. I have the benefits of the touch screen, there is still a keyboard thta I am accustomed to, and all the balckberry behaviors I am familiar with.There are a few items that have been a bit discouraging. The battery life is less than my curve, but I also use a LOT more features on this phone than I ever did on my curve, so I am sure that has a direct connection.The slide out keyboard is slightly recessed and that makes holding the 'ALT' key and using adjacent keys a little more difficult. However you can quickly switch to the on-screen keyboard in either portrait or landscape format and avoid that problem.My boyfriend has an iPhone and for what he does for a living it is perfect it has apps that he uses. However for corporate business the Blackberry torch is the perfect solution.I have a new addiction to add to my list, and I am sure my family does not like this phone even more than they did not like the last one.
