Actually, i am interested in this item and have intention to buy one.  I will use it in China after this year, so my question is whether i can use this 'unlocked' and 'international version' cellphone with a SIM offered by a certain Chinese service provider without do anything about the settings? What's the real meaning of 'INTERNATIONAL VERSION' ? I appreciate any kindly reply.
