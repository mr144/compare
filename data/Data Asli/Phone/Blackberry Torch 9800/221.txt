This phone works flawlessly.  The touch screen is easy to use and not overly sensitive.  The browser is great.  There are many things BlackBerry does so much better than anyone else such as contact management and instant message management, in my opinion.  Push email is awesome.  I have had BlackBerries and HTC and BlackBerry wins hands down.  I have friends with iPhones and while their phone is dead until they get to a place to recharge it all I have to do is pop the battery out and put a fresh one in and I am still going.  Being able to replace the battery on the fly is very important when I am out hiking or camping. One possible drawback to this particular phone is the OS6.  It is excellent in and of itself but my carrier does not support it and I was unable to get service books for the browser to work.  Check with your carrier to see if the phone is compatible and if the OS is compatible.  If not, a quick stop at Crackberry.com gave me the fix for that and now it works perfectly.  If you are using an unlocked phone not on the original carrier this website has all the answers.
