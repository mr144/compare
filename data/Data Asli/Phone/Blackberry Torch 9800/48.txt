I have used this phone for over a year now and here are some pros and consCons:-I had to replace the handset once after six months with keyboard and other hard key problems.- lack of useful apps- have to reboot after you install and uninstall apps to use them-ridiculously slow in downloading and installing apps- Got very sluggish over time and freezes often- only way to reboot is by taking the battery out.- Touch screen is not very responsive.Pros:- QWERTY keyboard- 5MP camera- Call qualityCan be used as a very basic phone. For a smart phone I would rather go with a iPhone or android
