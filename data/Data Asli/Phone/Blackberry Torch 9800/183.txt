I really like the features of the touchscreen Blackberry Torch, but for me and all of my friends that own it the software FREEZES ALL THE TIME. Non stop, I have to reboot the phone quite often.I replaced my old Iphone with this Blackberry solely given that 90% of my friends are on BBM (Blackberry Messanger), which is a great tool , btw. However, the software that RIM was able to pull together is way worse than Apple's iphone.Several times I cannot send an email because the screen freezes and the only way of exiting the screen is by turning the phone off! And I lose all the message that I have written. Bottom line: I am using my new Ipad to send emails nowadays.RIM please fix this issue soon.
