Second blackberry, and first touch screen phone.  I have had it for 4 days now and I love it, the touch screen will take a bit getting used to, but soon enough i'll be a pro, the battery lasts abt a day. Worldwide distributors was great, delivered it on the first day of the estimated delivery date. Thanks!
