I have had the pleasure of using a Blackberry device since the first Blackberry was launched. As a long time Blackberry user, I have found that I simply cannot get away from their product, nor do I want to. For a short period I had an iPhone but I could not get used to the keyboard. Every time I needed to write a long email I wanted to hit it with a hammer.Blackberry is simply the best for a business person or someone who needs to be typing on it all day. The keyboard on the Torch took a day to get used to vs the Curve but that was it. Here are a couple things I like about the Torch:1. Actual keyboard for those long e-mails.2. On screen keyboard for those quick texts or silent typing3. Calendar  - always simple, just start typing by the time of day and you are done.4. Better camera (Not iPhone 4 good, but good)There are many other additions to the Torch, but the simple fact is its a work horse phone plain and simple. If you want games and such, grab a new iPod. I still have my iPhone and will use it for messing around but I will always go to a Blackberry for work. Blackberry means business and iPhone and Android are there for wasting time (Not all apps of course are time wasters, but who can resist when you have Angry Birds just one click away?)Grab the new Torch, you wont be disappointed.
