First impressions are, bulky, wide, and heavy...but thats just first impressions, I found out later by exploring the torch phone, that it is elegant and well worth theextra weight, I am very pleased with my product and would not change it.the opperating system is modern fast and smart, this is exactly what I was looking for a phone that coulddeliver fast touch response and connect me to the world; excellence.When a later phone like this is released, just a tip, a little lighter,but if I have to live with it, then I certainly can.well worth the buy.
