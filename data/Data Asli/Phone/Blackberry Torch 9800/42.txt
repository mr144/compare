It worked ok for like the first 6 hrs i used it then the touch screen stopped working i tried to remedy this by updating the software and then after the screen started working for like 2 days now it wont even turn on come to find out is not a new phone. NEW PHONES do not NEED SERVICING this is the second them i bought a phone from amazon and it wasnt up to scratch the last one i bought came with out a camera when it was supposed to have one.
