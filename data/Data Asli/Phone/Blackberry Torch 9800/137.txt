This phone along with the rest of the blackberry product line is awful. You need to pull the battery out all the time to restart the phone. The internet is very slow and cannot open some pages. The only positive thing that comes along with the blackberry is BBM. Other than that the phone is junk. Blackberry really needs to step their game up if they want to compete in the smart phone market. They have not come out with a product that even comes close to the iPhone or the Droid. The app store is awful and tends to be way over priced. I do not understand why Blackberry has not shown any improvement or development towards a better phone, there is just no excuse. Overall I would not waste your money on a phone like this you are better off spending a bit more and get a solid phone like the iPhone 4 or 4s.
