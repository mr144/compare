So far so good, I bought this to use with Straight Talk service ($45 mo unlimited) and it does that well. Phone is very responsive, with almost zero lag switching between screens and loading apps. So far I am liking everything about this phone (coming from Nokia E71).  My download speeds, as checked on speedtest are over 5mbps, faster than my home DSL!  Screen size is nice, being slightly wider than other phones I have owned, makes watching movies and reading web pages nice. I ordered the Case-Mate case and really like it, also the Zagg screen protector which is very good and easy to install without air bubbles. Wanted to note that battery life out of the box was not that great as with many touch screen phones, but if you can limit the amount of background apps running, turn down the display brightness a little, and have the lock timeout set at 30 seconds to 1 minute, battery life can improve quite a bit. I use a battery saving app called 'Juice Defender'  it will shut down apps and automatically adjust settings for the best battery life. I have no problem with the phone running all day during normal use, but if used heavily playing games or watching movies a car charger is a good idea.
