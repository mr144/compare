I recently bought the phone and i am using it from last one month. The phone is great.It works quite well. After reading some reviews i was afraid to buy it. but now i am happy to have it . Battery is most people's concern and its somewhat true for a user who simultaneously uses many applications.But for normal use its battery lasts for a single day.Second concern was its AT&T phone so it wont work on TMobile. But its working quite good on TMobile.Its  great phone for someone who do not want to shell out more money and get the experience of using a touch screen phone.
