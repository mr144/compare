The phone is great, as usually for HTC phones. But it is NOT TRULY UNLOCKED as advertised. It only works fully with an AT&T provider, otherwise you cannot use all the apps or functions. For example you cannot have access to 4G or 3G, but have only access to edge. So if you are looking for an unlocked phone, buy it from someone else!
