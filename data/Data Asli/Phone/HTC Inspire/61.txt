Through out the life span of cell phones I have had countless types of phones, Samsung, HTC, Nokia, and Iphone, and that phones is worse than this one. The last time I had an HTC it did not work well at all. It would always freeze on me. So recently due to the fact that my Iphone was just a piece of fragile glass that shattered on me the first time it fell I decided to go for the HTC Inspire. Boy.. this phone is fun. There are so many features that not even Iphone has. It is fast, texting is  a lot more easier. The screen is a great size that you can see anything. It has a camera that puts Iphone camera to shame. Takes great pictures. So if you are thinking about a phone but not too sure which one to go for I recommend the HTC Inspire. You will not regret it I promise.. :)
