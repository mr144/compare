This is not as much a fault of the cellphone as the seller Ross electronics. I bought the cellphone in july 11 2012 and in september it started acting up by not charging corectly. As it was after the 30 day return window with amazon i decided to use my one year warranty via HTC. However when i called them up they said the cellphones IMEI number had been activated as of september 2011. Meaning my Warranty expired in september 2012!!. They basically sold me a one year old USED phone. IT ended up with me returning the phone to amazon in september 3 Months after i purchased it for a full refund. So Amazon really protected me and trusted me with my problem.So buyer beware make sure you contact the seller and verify that the cellphone is new so that you have a solid paper trail, and in case you did end up buying a used phone you can return it without a problem. It also is a very good idea to call the phone manufacturer and make sure the IMEI number is activated when you activate it, so that you know its new!!
