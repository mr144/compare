When i received this phone, I noticed right away that the screen was coming off.  I was poorly refurbished if at all.  In a couple months things have gone wrong.  The Microphone does not work and also the GPS cannot find a signal.  I have sent it to a repair service in Texas and they worked on it for 4 days.  They came to the conclusion that the mother board has a defect and i should return it.  This is a problem because it is past 30 Days. I hate bad business practice and this is a perfect example.  At no point was I to believe this phone was refurbished in the first place.
