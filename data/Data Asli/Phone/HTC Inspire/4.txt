I would recommend staying away from this phone. The  biggest reason is that this phone was made solely for ATT and somebody has managed to unlock it. In the process of unlocking the software is messed up and the phone Android system cannon be updated. I am stuck with some 2.2 version where as the world has moved on to 4.3.The touch screen is not that great either and within 6 months it has become very unresponsive.And believe me the phone is very heavy.
