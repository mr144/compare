I read all of the reviews about this phone. Some of the reviews were true the phone does turn on and off. my battery life is good not the best but I can live with that. I have a small charger I carry in my purse so no worries. I love the big screen! I have been searching and searching for a phone which does not require me to be under a contract. I had a reallll problem with finding a sim card that would allow me to use Straight Talk. I had to travel 2hrs! because WalMart website did not have any online. At the end of the day I am very impressed with the phone.
