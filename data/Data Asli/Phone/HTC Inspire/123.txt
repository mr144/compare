I finally broke down and purchased an unlocked smartphone. I can not believe all the things this phone does. I love it. I watch movies, play games, use internet, use GPS, make calls without any problems, and use Wi-Fi which saves surfing minutes on my carrier plan. The only problem I had was setting the VPN, but when I figured out that I had to go to my carrier's website to set that (They had online instructions.), all was good. I have had it for a couple of months now and I purchased an AT&T sim card out of curiosity and stuck with my TMobile prepaid plan. Now I can switch between AT&T and TMobile. It works great!
