As the smartphone screens getting bigger than my iphone, I am having a hard time finding a suitable one for my small hands.  This phone is nothing different from other smartphones out there, and eventually I return it after using it for only four days - nothing exciting to brag about.  I can not even multitask while talking and checking FB.  Just another boring phone.
