I am not able to get data internet for my T-mobile account.  I have spent several hours trying to get it to work. I spent a half hour on the phone with t-mobile trying to get it to work.  No luck. I spent an hour at the t[mobile store... they could not help. I thought I was getting a 4G phone that would work with my t-mobile account. I am very dissipointed. I sent an email to the seller and did not get any reply.  I would not by from them again.
