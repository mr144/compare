This phone (HTC Inspire 4G Unlocked Phone with 3G Support, 8 MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi and Android OS - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black) is a superstar.I feel good holding it, I also feel good using it. It is the best phone I have ever used. The battery life is short but i got back up batteries and charger for it.Sound quality is not the best but I can live with that considering that other features on it make for the shortcomings.The 'pros' on this phone is more than the 'cons' considering the fact that no phone is 100%.I am just loving mine.Beejay
