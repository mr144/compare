I was using a Google G1 that I generally liked but found a bit slow and that rebooted fairly often.  For my birthday I was given some money and told to get a newer phone -- after much searching (the variety of phones available in just staggering), I found the HTC Desire HD (AKA HTC Ace and other names) and am simply blown away at how much faster (and bigger) it is compared to my G1.  The battery seems to last forever (at least compared to my G1) even with the bigger screen and vastly faster processor and vastly greater memory.The one I bought was used but the condition was very accurately described.  The only problem was that it had been unlocked and rooted but not reset.  It took a few hours to discover that resetting it to 'factory' condition (not the OS, just the data) was necessary to get WiFi working (everything else worked).I use T-Mobile and the pay-as-you-go SIM card.  I have no data plan other than WiFi (or the $2/day data plan from T-Mobile if I really want mobile data). Thus, my costs (other than the phone) are $0.10/min. (No monthly fee at all.)I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for an Android!
