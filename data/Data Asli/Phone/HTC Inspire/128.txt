I bought this phone two days ago and got it following day. The shipping was excellent. So far I am toying with this phone and it is marvellous. My only challange so far is how to use the phone as wifi-hotspot for my other electronics in T-mobile network.It works will with Etisalat roaming with AT&T but could not work in T-mobile network.Please any idea on how I can use this wonderful function on Family-Mobile newwork which runs on T-Mobile infrastructure?Thanks
