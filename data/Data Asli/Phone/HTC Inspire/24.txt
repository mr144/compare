I purchased my phone from a Best Buy Mobile as an upgrade. Perhaps I simply got a lemon, but I have barely had this phone for a year, and have sent in for repairs twice, waited two weeks without a phone for a battery  replacement, and need to send it in for a third repair. Unfortunately, since the latest issue is a NEW issue, it will not be seen for repairs without $80-$300. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.Issues:Volume control button not workingConstant locking/freezingRandom shutdown/restarts with no promptingVery poor battery life-----After 11 months, battery stopped holding a charge entirelyTouch screen functionality lost, in random undamaged places
