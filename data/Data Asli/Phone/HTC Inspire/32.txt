When I received the phone, it was not unlocked as advertised. In addition, the seller only gives a 30 day warranty and would not help in any way once it stopped working. Six months after having the phone, it developed problems (constantly resetting itself). HTC tried everything to fix it using phone support, and subsequently,  I finally sent it in for repair. HTC indicated that the motherboard is probably bad. This was an ATT phone and I put it on a T-Mobile network. My brother got a Samsung II at the same time and he never had a problem with his phone or service. By purchasing an unlock phone, you may end up paying more in the end. I just paid to Express ship the phone back and do not know how long it will take to get it back. Next time, I will go with a phone from the carrier and avoid HTC, as I looked on the web and MANY people have had the same problem I experienced with this model phone. Buyer beware...
