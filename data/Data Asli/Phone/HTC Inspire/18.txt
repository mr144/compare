Have this phone for about a week or so and it has been working pretty good. The only couple of things that I did not like was that it does not have wifi calling like my last phone had (I live out in the country and get poor reception but I have DSL internet... go figure lol) and it did not initially connect to the T-Mobile's network for internet and sending and receiving pictures. The latter part was pretty easy to fix, I went to [...] and followed the instructions. For the wifi calling, I personally can live without it, but there are apps out there that will let you make calls through your wifi. There is a little bit of a battery drain but I think it has to do with searching for a signal in my area (for the other comments about the battery, check the active apps you have running and also if your phone is searching for a signal. If it is not then it is the battery and talk to the seller to see about getting a replacement for that). So all in all it is a nice little sexy phone for the price and it has been doing pretty good for me so far.
