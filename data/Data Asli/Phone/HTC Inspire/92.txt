I must say I am highly pleased with this phone. The camera is great, and it handles all of my 3d games well.  The only thing that this phone is missing is a front facing camera for video chat but for all the features I got for under $300.00 I could not ask for more. The screen is huge and vibrant which was another plus for me and the call quality is pretty good. To sum it up this is an excellent phone at an excellent price.
