Have this phone now for 5 month and do not believe there is a better phone at this price on the market. Phone is fast and battery live is not as bad some people report. With normal use, GPS and Bluetooth disconnected, battery hold up to 12 hours.It connects very fast to internet and fast for downloading apps. As other people reported here, today after five month I am still finding new uses. It is a little bit large phone, but very slim and therefore comfortable to use. I bought an Otterbox shelf and it grows to a small little tank, but well protected and still goes in a pocket. Last month the earphone failed and I could still use it with the speaker until my son found the spare part and send it to me in Venezuela. Here the phone was repaired and after three hours I got it back like new. The phones sound is below average but I uses it with a small Monster speaker connected with bluetooth and sound is very good, the same with headphones. With a 16 GB micro SD  card I have over 860 songs and music and a lot of apps stored and still 8,8 GB left. I reommend this phone to people wanting an Iphone but are not willing to spend this much.They will receive the same or more satisfaction with the Android system.
