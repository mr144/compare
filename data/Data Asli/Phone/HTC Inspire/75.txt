Does not work on T-mobile network as advertised. This is not an unlocked phone, it is an AT&T branded phone. I am so pissed. I just activated a new T-mobile account only to find out that this is an AT&T phone. It has AT&T right on the phone as well as loaded with their apps. T-mobile uses different frequency's than AT&T.
