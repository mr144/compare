I bought this phone a little over a month ago. The only apps I really care about are facebook and instagram, and this phone runs both fine. However, it is overall very laggy and freezes often. Sometimes the phone will shut off and the only way to get it to turn back on is to remove & reinsert the battery.Also, even though the MP of the camera is high, do not be fooled. The picture quality is very low. It also does not have an inside camera which makes taking pictures of yourself difficult. After a month the charger port became loose and  the phone would no longer charge. I was able to exchange my phone but they (CellLounge) sent me a refurbished phone, and it kept shutting off in the midst of setting it up. The very next day it would not turn on no matter how many times I removed & reinserted the battery. Since I could not be given a new phone I requested a refund.I purchased a Motorola Atrix which is WAY faster, takes better pictures and does not shut off on me (it is also cheaper!).
