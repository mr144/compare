I just got home and found the package on the front door. The stipulated time was perfect. I just opened the phone box and it is all inside, the box looks a bit damaged on the corners, but not a big problem.Only one thing! I did not receive any micro SD card (8GB) as stated in the advertisement. This is my first purchase from amazon, someone could tell me how to contact the seller? If that problem solved I'll get to say everything is PERFECT.I bought the HTC Inspire 4G, a headset, a hard case, a car charger and an extra USB cable to get it charged at my office.The phone IS unlocked :D
