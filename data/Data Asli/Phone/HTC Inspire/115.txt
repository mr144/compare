I had an HTC Incredible2 with my cell phone compamny but it would not work with Consumer Cellular whose programs better suits my limited needs for a cell phone. This phone has everything I wanted -- my little computer when I am away from home. It takes great photos, particularly outside. The Incredible2 took better flash photos.
