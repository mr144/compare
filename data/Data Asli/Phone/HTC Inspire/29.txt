On the page where they were selling this phone it clearly said NEW;. When I finally got my phone it arrived in an old and beat up box and the charger was broken. I could not get into the Market, and a lot of the other cool applications and tools that this phone is supposed to have for the optimal cell phoning experience. After hours on online forums and on the phone with HTC trying to figure out how to fix the phone they eventually ended up telling me that if a factory reset was allowing me to use the applications and the tools then the phone was defective. Not only was the phone defective but the person that I was messaging about this product was blatantly lying to me about this phone being new. The phone came in an old beat up box, the charger was broken, and there were clear signs on the phones settings that nobody bothered to erase that this phone was used. Not only was the product a big headache but sow as the customer service. What made even more mad was the fact that they do not want to admit that they are selling old refurbished phones as &#34;new&#34;. Screw this phone and screw this company.
