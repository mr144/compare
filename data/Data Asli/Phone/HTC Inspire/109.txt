This is the first smartphone I have ever bought and I have had it for almost a year with it and it still rocks for me!I am writing this review approximately 9 months after i got the phone because most reviews I read are from the phone when it is new so one does not know how long will the phone actually last (at least working properly) but this time I tell you it is still as good as new (except the battery life but that's a common smartphone problem).I live in Venezuela and I wanted a good quality new smartphone so some friends told me that HTC is a good manufacturer but their phones almost never make it to our country. So I decided to buy this one online (unlocked) and see how it goes.I must say this phone has worked wonders with me. I went from the original 2.2 firmware to 2.3 and then 4.0 (upgrading via root) and it has worked for me everytime.It does have the usual smartphone battery issues but that something that happens to every phone so I do not really mind. With internet (WiFi or 3G/4G) enabled it lasts for a day or so, and it takes like an hour or two of charge.The phone is very fast and responsive even though I have never used it for playing games but I have a lot of applications installes and they all run very smoothly.Had no problems with the delivery either so I am very satisfied overall.I reccomend this to anybody who wants a fast yet not so expensive smartphone.
