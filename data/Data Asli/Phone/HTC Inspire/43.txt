The phone seems fine until I tried to use it.  The BATTERY keeps ONLY ONE HOUR charge.  I am really disapointed and want a refund.  How do I return it or get a good battery????  What good is a cell phone that dies before you need it?  I am very unhappy.  It was a gift and I am totally embarassed to give a worthless gift, even if it is supposed to be refurbished.  No excuse.
