In general not a bad phone.  Nice screen size and quality.  Perhaps a tad heavy.  Enough juice in the battery for one day use.  Do not forget to charge regularly.  Volume controls are not very responsive and opening and closing the phone to replace/insert SIM, MicroSD, and/or battery is a nuisance as the plastic covers are difficult to use.Rooting/unlocking the phone is not too complicated apart from the challenge to enter HBOOT mode requiring powering on while holding the volume-down button.  The volume button is extremely unresponsive and I probably had to boot 25 times before being successful.
