Unhappy...This phone is not unlock ....My T-mobile sim-card does not allow internet in my cell. Wi-fi works great but internet does not work at all making impossible to receive picture messages.also does not have a front camera..no good to make video calls.UPDATEI contacted the seller.He told me to call Tmobile and ask them to first change the IMEI number on the account and they can send a text message to your phone and change the Internet setting to their server configuration I called and they helped me very nicely and guide me step by step how to fix the issue and now I am very happy because my phone is working perfectly! The only thing is I still can not make video calls because it does not have a front cameraUPDATETmobile solve the isue but still sometimes i loose signal in places where i always had reception before with a tmobile phone.It drains the battery really quick.Last night i fully charge it and my mid day the battery was almost dead withouth been use at all.Unhappy...I am trying to get a refund  :(
