I was very pleased with the product/service!  I ordered an HTC phone and it came super fast!  After about a day of using it, i noticed that the the battery was not charging all the way when i would charge it overnight.  When i contacted Recell it!  They were super friendly and helpful - offered me a partial refund so that i could get a new charger.  I am super pleased at the fast delivery and very prompt customer service.  I highly recommend this seller, they know what they are doing
