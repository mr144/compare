This is a wonderful phone that is doing everything it is supposed to now that I have all the parts it was supposed to come with.  When I received the phone there was a note saying that they had not had time to unlock it so I should e-mail the seller and get the code.  I did and within an hour I received the code and the phone unlocked easily.  I also had not received the 8g mini SD memory card it was supposed to come with.  This was a bit more of a problem since you can not take pictures or save anything without it.  I asked the seller for the memory card and he sent it immediately which showed up in a few days.  Now that I have all the bits and pieces it is working wonderfully.  The battery goes quickly so be sure to recharge it often and get a car battery so when you are on the move you can recharge it.
