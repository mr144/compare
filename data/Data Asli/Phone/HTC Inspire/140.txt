By far, the best phone I have ever had. I was a nokia user since decades and I have seen bad reviews about this cell but the need to evolve and get over the old nokis OS and its limitations made me had a change. This cel phone is just awesome. It ai not perfect at all but the combination is just great. The iPhone screen is better but only that, others have more RAM but only that, others have more CPU speed but just that, this one is a bit lower than the tops but has everything put together. high speed, high RAM, the screen looks great, the GPS locks on fast and it is very precise, it is aluminum body makes it hard enough to take some falls and the gorilla display will assure you a safe screen. Battery sucks but, every high end cell phone I have seen drain batteries so.. just accept it and get a few extra batteries with you or a travel charger.
