After having this phone for just over a month it just stopped working.  The whole screen is blank and it is not responding to any input.  It was fully charged, so that is not the issue.  Just for the sake of it I tried charging but the little orange light that comes on to indicate that it is charging is not even lighting.  Other people's reviews suggest this is not an isolated case with this model. I had actually liked the phone until this point.  I am strongly considering returning it.
