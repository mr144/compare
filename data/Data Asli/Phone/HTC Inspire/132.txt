I really like this phone.  The screen is excellent.  However when I am on a phone call, my cheek FREQUENTLY hits either the mute or speaker button during a call.  I have  to remember to hold the phone only to my ear, but not let it tough my face.  This is a really annoying problem.  Also, the battery can only make it through about 3/4 of the day before I need to recharge it.  There are a lot of things I love about this phone, but a lot of little things keep me from giving it a better score.  I bought this to using on Walmart's family plan.  I get pretty good service, and I am pleased at the money I am saving buy going with a cheaper cell company.
