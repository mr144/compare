This phone does it all  - almost. a great screen large enough to show movies with great definition. the camera and video camera both are great. The programs and applications offered are just amazing. my only wish was for more memory internally. the construction is great. Solidly built. If you do not mind the slightly extra weight then this is for you. On my belt, I do not feel it, but it starts to weigh in while holding it. not that this bothers me too much. My real complaint is the playback audio. Not that great. I would need to play with the settings some more to get what I want. WIth headphones no issues.The programs and responsiveness are good. You do not have to wait forever for applications to load up. In this regard it blows many other phones (BB) out of the water. With this phone that is significantly cheaper I do not feel like I am missing an Apple phone at all. yeah - refuse to call it what its real name is!
