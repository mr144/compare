Great Camera, takes good photos. Feels good in the hand. Removable battery, you can buy a spare for around $5 (comes in handy when you are traveling, and you can have a fully charged spare battery in your pocket). Tough Quality, (dropped it couple of times and no cracks on the screen). No front camera. Slows up from time to time. Other Things to Consider. The phone did freeze from time to time and I had to remove the battery in order to unfreeze it, but this stopped after upgrading from Android 2.2 to 2.3.Currently runs on Android 2.3 Gingerbread; Successors to 2.3 are in following order: Ice Cram Sandwich 4.0, Jelly Bean 4.1, Jelly Bean 4.2.Yes, the phone works with Tmobile, but you will not get 4g speed. Not a problem if you only want data for email and twitter or if you only plan to use wifi.
