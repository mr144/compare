This was a Christmas gift for my oldest daughter, who wanted a camera with a big zoom on it. Compared to other brands it seemed like a pretty good deal, but in the end it is just not very satisfying to use.On the plus side, it has a relatively fast lens (2.8 I think) and the backlight sensor should in theory improve low light performance. The zoom is massive and the camera has a nice solid feel to it. The menu can be a little confusing, but once you get the hang of it you'll find a nice variety of features and settings.On the negative side, the LCD is awful. Now, maybe I am biased since I use a DSLR or the nice bright viewfinders of my old medium format film cameras, but this does not even compare to a decent point and shoot. Colors looked washed out and movement is jerky. But even that does not compare to how sluggish the camera is after pressing the shutter. I have seen from other reviews that holding down the shutter half-way after taking a picture can bypass the glacial shooting interval, but I have never had much luck getting that to work. Instead it is take a picture, wait a few seconds, and take another one. Not what you did expect from a digital camera in 2012. The shutter button itself feels like you are pressing a wet noodle, so that does not make doing the 'half-press' trick any easier.Unfortunately these problems are found on a lot of 'prosumer' cameras in this price range. So I really do not know whether this Kodak is any worse than a comparable Nikon or Canon megazoom. My suggestion is to forget the big zoom and find a camera with a good low light lens that takes fast pictures. A Canon S100 is a good example. You'll do better taking a good picture at 5x zoom and cropping it than trying to take a 20x zoom shot and hoping it does not come out a blurry mess.
