The camera has all the features I would need and seems to be user friendly in accessing the features. Although I have not had the chance to use the camera extensively yet, I do like it and the battery life seems satisfactory for the number of shots I took so far. Rechargeable AA batteries are something I have to get used to - I never had to deal with these in a camera. So far so good...  The deal I got through Amazon.com was the decisive factor in purchasing this camera when so many others were available everywhere! So far, I am happy with the deal and with the camera.
