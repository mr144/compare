Camera works well as descibed in most of the reviews I read. The delay in auto preview has proved to be more annoying than I thought it would. I use the camera to take pitures of my children and they often move before i can snap the next photo. Overall happy with it.  SD card is easy to take out and put directly in my laptop.
