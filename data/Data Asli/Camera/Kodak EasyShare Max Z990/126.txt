Like everything in life theres pros and cons, but this camera for the price is an absolute bargain, of course if you compare it with similar items (characteristics)maybe this Kodak will lack behind in some points, but we are talking products that doubles or more the price of this very fine camera.I will definetly recommend to buy the Kodak Z990, if you are looking for a bridge camera.Did i mention the 30X Zoom? awesome.
