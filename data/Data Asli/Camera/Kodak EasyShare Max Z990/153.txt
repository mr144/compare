I bought this camera as a quick solution for my vacations photography. Now every time when I have to use it I regret it.First of all - the camera is slow, its zoom makes me mad every time when I wish to get a particular part of the scene. It always has its own way to zoom and rarely allows me to get the right zoom. Sometimes zoom stops in the middle of zooming and does not want to go one or other way.The camera eats batteries like no other camera I had before. It can 'consume' new batteries in a matter of a few hours, about 200 pictures.Finally the funny Kodak RAW format that cannot be converted by a standard graphics software. You have to use the Kodak proprietary software that does not support batch conversion. You have to convert your photographs one-by-one. Any way - never more Kodak cameras.
