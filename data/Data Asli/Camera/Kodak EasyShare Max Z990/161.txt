After reviewing several of the bridge cameras, I decided to buy this one.  The main reason was that the price was the lowest  ...and stacked on that this camera can do automatic HDR photos, as well as scrolling panoramas and has a ton of awesome features.  Having used the camera on a trip to italy, I can say that the photos are truly breathtaking.  Also, there are quick buttons like 'self-timer' and  amulti-shot'.  In other cameras, I have had to scroll through menus to set the self-timer.  With the z990, there's a button that simplies toggles this features.  ...very easy to use.  so a great camera, high value for the price, amazing pics, lots of cool features, I made the right choice.
