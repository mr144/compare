Pretty much every comparison I have seen for this camera gives it a losing rap.  I have seen reviews where it falls to EVERY other camera in it is class by a couple of points here and there.  The biggest problem that is not compared in the review is the price.  The Canon, Sony, and Nikon are all priced over $300, and with a little shopping, you can find this guy for about $150.  As far as the performance, it is great with a fast Read/write SD card, and a little patience.  IT IS NOT A DSLR, but can take pictures as good as one sometimes...  Very pleased with this camera, the best I have had for a P&S.
