We purchased this camera 13 months ago - when it worked it worked very well - however, the camera has frozen up for no reason!  We took it on vacation last month, and could not use it - much to our dismay.  When we contacted Kodak, they said that it was 1 month past the guarantee and would do nothing about it.  EXTREMELY upsetting.  DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA - in fact, do not buy Kodak period.  Their support staff is overseas, and there is no one to really talk to, and the web sites for problem shooting are USELESS!  I can not state this strongly enough - do not buy this camera.  UPDATE:  Since I last published this, we sent it in to have it fixed - fortunately we had a 3 year warranty we purchased through Amazon.  It turns out they had to replace the entire circuit board!  So I was right - this is NOT a good product.  The place that repaired it indirectly indicated this was a common problem.  So, Kodak, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT?
