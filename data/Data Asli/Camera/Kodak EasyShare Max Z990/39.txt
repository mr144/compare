This is an amazing camera for the price range(+$400 range originally) and i got it for $188 on sale... The video on this camera is very nice 1080 format and beautiful in the right light... i find it amazing on some reviews that try to compare the images to higher priced cameras and rate it lower... These images are Awesome! Like most tools, you have to learn(yup, take some time to learn for optimal output) and get used to the controls and then it becomes second nature... i find learning the new skill set is also adding to the level of creativity you can explore along the way...Short version = you can not go wrong with this camera... and at anywhere under $200, it is a steal...my friend just got one of these after playing with mine for $189... hahaha...inJOY! namaste
