Owned over a year. A little sluggish after take picture but if you apply light pressure on the button for your next shot, its ready to go. Macro and Super Macro looks great on eBay.  I went to a Sony battery charger because this charger was an overnight charge which may be convenient for most people but not for me. Batteries can hold a charge for several weeks or even months if camera is seldom used and gives you several hundred shots. Which is nice because it is always ready for the unexpected use.  All in all nice camera for the money.
