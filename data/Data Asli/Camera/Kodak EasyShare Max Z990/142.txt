Two years ago, I took a photo of the moon while I was flying on a plane. That camera had 10x zoom, and I got a massive moon that filled the whole image, showing me the mountains and cracks of the moon.Today, 5/6/12, is the moon day in Asian culture; it is said that of all 365 days, the moon is brightest today. And unfortunately, I am in the midst of a final exams hazard and cannot hop on a plane. However, I decide to try my new Kodak Z990 anyway. The result is astounding! Even though I was standing on the ground, I get the clear moon I got on the plane--only clearer!This camera is undoubtedly one of the best for $200. Its menu system requires some getting used to, since it is displayed on top of the screen in pictorial form, rather than full screen. But once I get used to it, I find the Kodak Z990 menu system a lot more convenient than other fullscreen menus, because the top of the screen menu allows me to see my image and adjust the settings concurrently.The only complaint I have is that the neck strap is loose, and today, one side of the strap falls off while I was shooting. Fortunately, I noticed the problem while I installed the strap, so I gripped the camera firmly at all times. I will probably buy a better strap soon.**Update: I just found that, according to wikipedia, Kodak announced that it will 'stop making digital cameras.' Therefore, sending the camera in for repair may be difficult. My camera does not require fixing yet. But you should keep this in mind when deciding whether to buy this camera.
