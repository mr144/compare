I had this for about two weeks. Took some great pictures. Fantastic zoom but a bit slow. Great sensor that worked really well in low light. Auto Focus was a bit clunky and switching to manual focus is was really awkward. Most obvious trying to shoot through a fence. It was actually quicker to point as some distant object elsewhere then turn back to the shot with the focus held. Another negative was battery life. With some zooming and AF I think I could only get about 40 pics between charges.I had a moment where the lens would not retract and the camera froze/crashed. Batteries out for a bit made it work again. A couple of days later the lens would not return again. From that point on the camera just said 'Lens Obstructed. Remove lens cap'. Tried the batteries but searching online I realized this is a common problem. I returned it.
