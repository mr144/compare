I purchased a refurbished Kodak Z990 as a gift.  It arrived quickly, in good condition.  The recipient loves it, it is a good camera, especially for outdoors.  The batteries are not so great, also apparently used, but we can get new ones.  Happy with Kodak, wish they would continue with the cameras.
