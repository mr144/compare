Got this for chaperoning a jr. hi trip to NY. My old camera is a Panasonic Lumix 6mp with only 6x optical zoom. It took some very nice shots, but I wanted more zoom. Very easy to set up. Lots of settings to play around with, still playing with it. The zoom is great, but as others say, if you are using maximum zoom, it is best to be using a tripod for a steady shot. Also shot some HD video with it. Very nice and okay audio quality. I like it using AA batteries, if a set dies, you can get more anywhere, no waiting for a recharge. Also, I recently picked up the remote for clearance at $4 at a big name, electronics store. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.
