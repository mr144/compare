I am very pleased with my new Kodak EasyShare Max Camera.  No one can believe thegood price I got it for  from Amazon.  I know very little about cameras but bought this to take on my Paris trip.  (Oct 15 to 22nd)  The pictures are wonderful.  Great quality but my composition needs work.  Last night I took my first photo class through National Camera's.  I can say I was taught alot and I am looking forward to using my camera with my new knowledge.Thank you.  I love my Camerasincerely,Judy Haley
