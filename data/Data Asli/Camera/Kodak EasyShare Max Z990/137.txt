I have had this camera about 2 weeks now. In that time I have not put the camera down once and have went through every single setting and menu until I knew the camera like the back of my hand. That being said, here is my review.My first use of this camera was on a beach vacation trip. And what I first learned about this camera is that it takes really decent pictures in high light and all of the modes it provides. And with the options it gives you in  amanual' mode, it really lets you customize how you want you photo.On the other hand, this camera boasts a top 6400 iso. Iso is tricky on any camera but this one is practically useless after 400 iso. The images are just horrible.Now about the auto-focus. As much as I 'like' this camera. This continuous AF has driven me up the wall. So it is likely you'll want to use the single AF.Video on this camera is on par with the quality of photos. Not the best but it is still 1080p and is relatively smooth if it is on a tripod. Zoom is exceptional.I like this camera. but it will not be staying around for very long. It has literally driven me to take the step to get a entry level DSLR. I have learned enough in the  amanual' mode to know what I need to know to handle my first DSLR.If you would like to see some real life photos taken by this camera you can visit my photo gallery.[...]
