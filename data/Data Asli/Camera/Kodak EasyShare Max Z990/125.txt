I received the product in very good time. It was as advertised and in new condition. I was happy that it shipped in such a fast manner. I am a little disenheartened by the slowness of the product, but that is not the sellers fault. It is Kodak's fault and the fault of past reviews that I looked up that did not state that sometimes you get no response when you press the buttons or try to take a picture.
