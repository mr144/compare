This camera is pretty good. I have seen people complain about the menus but they do not seem too bad to navigate (the one on my DSLR is rather intensive as well). I use it mostly without the display and use the viewfinder. For now I just have regular lithium batteries in it. I am still getting used to the viewfinder outside as I did only had optical viewfinders before (even in my old 3.1 MP), but at least I can see out of this one (a previous one I got in 2009 I returned then got the DSLR for a trip, but it is a little too much for me). The zoom is easy to use. Takes great pics with low light.I updated the firmware with the only file I could find. This was Version 1.12, release date 2011-11. All it said was: 'This firmware version addresses an issue that may cause incorrect display of the time.' Is this the one that's supposed to speed up the picture taking process/picture saving time? Pics without the flash seem to go faster and I know about holding the shutter button halfway down. But flash pics seem to still take a long time to process. I have not yet tried a better card. Any suggestions?And to people who say it is too heavy--did you check it out before you bought it? I think it is very light.Considering I updated a 3.1 MP from 2002 I had no where to go but up! Good overall camera for the price.
