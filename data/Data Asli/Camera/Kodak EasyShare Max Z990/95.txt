I love taking pictures, and like to stick with Kodak cameras.  This camera is THE BEST camera I have ever had, and it is probably the least expensive one that I have had.  I did a lot of research before purchasing, and took the recommendations!!  I have had it for 2 months, and have been suggesting it to my friends!!  One friend had spent 3 times as much on a Canon, the Kodak Z990 is just as good for SO much less!!
