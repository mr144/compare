I do not normally take the time to do reviews, despite purchasing lots on amazon.  Just got back from trip with a friend who had a different digital SLR camera.  I knew my camera was slow, but did not realize that it was ABNORMALLY SLOW until comparing to hers.  Her pics and response of camera are much better than this one.  The kodak is so bad my 2 year old now says 'cheese....cheese...cheese' because he knows from pose to picture can take up to TEN, yes 10 seconds, on some days.  Other days, maybe 2 secs.  Camera is finicky.  Look elsewhere....like panasonic...
