I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!! I AM NOT A PRO AT SHOOTING PHOTOS, BUT I WANTED A REPLACEMENT CAMERA WITH A LONGER ZOOM AND THIS ONE FILLS THE BILL. THE LONG ZOOM SHOTS ARE CLEAR AND THE COLORS ARE GREAT. I LIKE THE 3 KODAK TYPE FILM SETTING TOO. YOU CAN CHOOSE KODACOLOR, EKTACHROME, OR KODACHROME EFFECTS IF YOU WANT. I SOMETIMES USE THE MANUAL SETTINGS TOO AND STILL GET GREAT RESULTS. AMAZONS BUNDLE PRICE WAS THE BEST I FOUND. BUY THIS CAMERA AND DON'T FORGET TO UPDATE THE FIRMWARE AND FORMATT THE SD CARD TO INCREASE THE SPEED AND FEATURES OF THIS BABY. OH,.. I TOOK THIS CAMERA TO WORK AND TWO CO-WORKERS WANT ONE TOO. PICK THIS ONE UP. (IT FEELS GOOD IN YOUR HANDS.) I DON'T THINK YOU WILL BE DISAPOINTED. TXS AGAIN AMAZON.
