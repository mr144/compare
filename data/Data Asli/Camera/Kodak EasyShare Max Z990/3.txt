BUYER BEWARE!!!!!! The Kodak Z990 optical zoom lens does not focus correctly. Had to send the camera to Kodak for repair. Bought the used-like new Kodak camera from Amazon Warehouse Deals, Inc. They never bother sending it back to Kodak for repair. Sold it like it is used-like new with a defect. Amazon Warehouse Deals, Inc never inspect the camera to see if it worked properly. Also, bought another Kodak Z990 camera from Amazon.com not from their Amazon Warehouse Deals, Inc. This was my second Kodak Z990 camera. I am waiting on my first Kodak camera for repair which I will not be getting it back in two or three weeks. Also, have the same issue with the optical zoom lens does not focus correctly when taking pictures from a far distant, but this was a BRAND NEW Kodak Z990 camera. So, I am thinking that all of the first generation batch of Kodak Z990 cameras have the same problem with their optical zoom lens does not focus correctly when taking pictures from a far distant. I am mentioning this to potential buyer that you should beware if you are buying this sort of defective camera from Amazon or Ebay. If you are buying a use Kodak Z990 camera, and you found out there is something wrong with the optical zoom lens, make sure you have the original sale slip. If you do not have the original sale slip, Kodak will not fix it. You would have to pay to fix the camera.
