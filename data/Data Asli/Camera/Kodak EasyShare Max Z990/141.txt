if you want something to make you life miserable the z990 and any other compact digital is the ideal choice,the LED screen keeps turning off.flash is the default so if you want photos with incandescent light you are screwed as the flash always operates unless you keep setting it to off.bridge cameras are too small to have easily controllable features.i would not have this camera even if it were free
