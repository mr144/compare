I ordered my Z990 and received it within two days. Everything was as advertised. I got in touch with a representative because my video would not play. He was helpful and as it turned out, it was NOT the camera but the computer. This was a really good deal on a really good camera. It has a lot more than I need, but I am learning as I go. It is VERY easy to use in it is 'Do not know much about cameras' setting. I would highly recommend both the camera and the company, Otter Creek Trading.
