Well, I just got the camera today and at first the pictures were kind of fuzzy; but after I messed with the settings a bit I noticed that the pictures were coming out much more crisp.The video is quite nice as well, 720p or 1080p they are both recorded very well with this camera.As for the zoom I think is a pretty cool feature although I do not care much for it, and as for the camera itself the feel is nice and comfortable overall I did give this camera a 9/10.&#10086;
