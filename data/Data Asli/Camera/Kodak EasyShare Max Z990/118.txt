To be honest, when I first held the camera I thought that it would not be good. It just felt too light and too-cheap-plasticky for my liking. But then when I took a few pictures, I realised how good the quality actually was. The lens zoom was truly remarkable - I tested it and could zoom in to see a traffic light about 0.2 miles away (about 300m). The low light level capability is not great however. Still, for the price, it is good for a digital camera, although SLR enthusiasts will want to look elsewhere.
