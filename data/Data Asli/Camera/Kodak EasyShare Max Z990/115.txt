The Z990 was everything I wanted of a replacement camera.  I bought it as a replacement for an earlier 5meg Kodak camera.  The reviews warned me of problems with picture quality and battery life.  I quickly discovered how to deal with the problems.  The fully automatic setting is too automatic -- moreso than in earlier models.  Following the manufacturer's suggestion I use the P mode which is as fully automatic and I want and does not over correct pictures -- the setting screens can be hidden.  The battery issue came up immediately and led to the purchase of a new charger.  The quick charger provided by Kodak has prongs that are shorter than American standard length -- I learned from the replacement charger that they are Chinese length.  The result was that the charger tended to disconnect from the electric service thereby not fully charging the batteries.  A new charger handled this problem.  Camera great; charger yuk!
