Let me start by saying that you will never ever get another camera like this one for this price, period. Cameras with these features cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars. I thinks this was Kodak's way of saying thanks to consumers for their over 130 years of loyalty, before closing its doors. I guess the release of the Z990 leaves similar cameras made by other manufacturers begging for mercy. I am a professional photographer, meaning I live off photography, so I chose this camera using a lot of professional judgment, taking into consideration everything starting from the camera's ergonomics to the sharpness of the lens, and believe me, look no further, you will not regret it. Its 1080p HD video is superb and the sharpness and quality of the optics at the maximum and minimum focal lengths are just insane, I'll dare to say, even better than most high end cameras out there. I really do not have anything negative to say about it considering that some professional cameras are sometimes very annoying to operate, so operating this one at least for me is easy. I hope this review helps in your buying decision. Cheers!
