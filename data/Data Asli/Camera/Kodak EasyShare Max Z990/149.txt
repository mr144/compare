I will not add another long review of technical info and comparisons. There are many many good reviews for that! What I do have to say is I have been eyeing this camera for almost two years. This camera has a lot of features that I was looking for, and after using it for a few days - it did not disappoint. For the features and the for the price, I could not beat it. Maybe there are some quirks and issues, but Kodak is still very helpful but over all I am delighted.To get the full use of this camera, you really need to put the booklet down it comes with and go to the Kodak website for the FULL user manual to get a complete picture. If you do not you still have a great easy to use camera, but you are missing out on a lot of GREAT features that once you get to know and understand them, they are really easy to use and help you take amazing pictures.Again, this camera is unbeatable for the price I paid.
