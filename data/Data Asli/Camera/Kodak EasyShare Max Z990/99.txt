I have started taking photos at work, as part of my job.  They did not have a camera so I used my older kodak for awhile, until they bought a nikon z810.  My kodak z1012is is so much better at taking photos that I decided to get another kodak before they were all gone since they have stopped making them.  The z990 was the best price for what you got that I could find.  This camera totally rocks.  It does so much more than anyone really needs a camera to do and it does it all so well.  In comparison to the much more expensive nikon, this is easily four times the camera.This camera will focus on the item you wish to take a photo of quickly without you having to sit and wait.  The nikon takes forever and sometimes it just wont focus on something (luckily I am taking photos of something that sits still).The camera flash on this kodak does not wash out the colors, unlike the nikon.I guess I should just say that overall if you are shopping for a nice camera, stop looking this one does everything the average user will ever need and more. there is several setting for ease of use so you can just point and shoot, or set something up yourself for a more artist flare.The added batterys, charger, cable, and memory card, make this camera ready to go right out of the box with nothing more than a optional case to buy to make it complete.
