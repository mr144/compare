Have only had the camera a few days. I own small compact point & shoots but they are useless at school graduations/school plays/dance recitals. One of my daughters performs in concerts, plays, Carnegie Hall, etc. and needed something with a great zoom. I have had Olympus, Nikon, Canon small compacts and an older Kodak 10X zoom and the kodak has always taken pictures on par with the Canon, with more menu choices. This is the best compromise between a compact & a SLR. The zoom is fantastic and a huge improvement over my 10X kodak zoom, no blurring in optical zoom whatsover. I videotaped a show and there was very minimal movement, my 10x kodak zoom was so hard to keep steady during videotaping. I was in Santa Fe earlier this year on vacation and my canon compact just did not do justice to the scenery. I would like to go back there with this camera. It is bulkier, but the pictures it takes are worth it. I will still keep the small compact point & shoot in my pocketbook but I have a feeling this camera will accompany me more often. And this camera bundle was under $200. Ca not beat that for a great zoom camera.
