Pros:  Price was excellent.  Color is beautiful in the photos and art prints I have sold in my business. I did read reviews about this camera prior to buying and knew of the &#34;cons&#34; but am still including in my review below.Cons: 1) You can not take multiple photos in a row, camera does not process fast enough.  Probably a good 15-20 seconds needed between each photo for the viewing screen to reappear.  2)  Battery life is very short and I do not take hundreds of photos a day or week.  More like 25-50 photos a week and I need to recharge the batteries every two weeks.  That seems really short to me.
