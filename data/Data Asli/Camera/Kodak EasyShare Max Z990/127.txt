I have the Z740 model. It was my first digital camera.  Since it was new to me, at that time, I did not realize problems that existed.  The flash always flashes, even when it is in the off mode.  When I realized it should not be this way I called Kodak.  The man who I spoke with would not acknowledge this as a problem.  The camera should have been returned and replaced by Kodak since it cost over $350.  The batteries would not recharge and he sent me a recharger replacement but he came across like he was doing me a great big favor.Recently, I received an email from Kodak stating someone else was taking over their photo web site, can not remember who.My first video attempt was a success.  I followed the cat around for a couple minutes, much to her dismay.  The camera picked up every sound with excellent clarity and the movie was perfecly clear.  It's video is a great feature.  At family gatherings it comes in handy.  My relatives complain the camera light is too bright.  It would be nice if Window software could be used, the camera only supports use of Quick Time.I like the camera.  The numerous zooms feature is its best asset.  Not sure if I would purchase another Kodak.
