Am so far very happy with this camera, particularly the results when photos are taken at maximum range. Still experimenting and practicing as I have a trip to Europe in June 2013 and would like to be able to get some great shots while away.The value for money is excellent and I could only get a basic point and shoot camera for what the Kodak Z990 cost me.
