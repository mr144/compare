Fairly easy to use but takes some time to learn all it can do.  My daughter-in-law was in the Mrs Washington contest last weekend (4th place) and I was disappointed that I could not use the camera's capabilities very well.  The battery indicator showed almost full when the pageant started but after only 8 shots it was dead.  Be sure to have fully charged batteries or an extra set with for any important events.
