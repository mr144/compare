If your like me and want to take high quality pictures but do not want to spend $500 plus on a camera, this is a great option. The 30X zoom is great for macro shots, and the 12MP is more than adequate to blow up your pictures for printing. There are a bunch of good presets but it also has a manual mode as well. I have had this camera for over a year now and really the only negatives I have encountered are:1.The battery meter does not always seem to be accurate2.The write/transfer speeds can be slow (I am getting a class 10 SD card to help alleviate that.)I would definitely recommend this camera for the amateur/aspiring photographer!
