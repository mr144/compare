When reading the description it was advertised to have manual shutter operation. After I got it and read the directions for manual operation, it shows the manual shutter button as the button to take pictures. Something any idiot already knows.It takes fair pics but in max zoom every thing has a halo. stars look like donuts. Maybe camera error. If so, I am irked because it is supposed to be like new, not like malfunctioning.I'll call customer service to determine if I should return this or not..2/13/2013 called Kodak customer service was unable to get an english speaking person.I was told to wait for a call back 5 to 7 days. This camera will not focus even on a tripod and continually throws errors.I feel the reviews were put in falsly to sell this product. SHAME AMAZON!!!I'll probably NEVER buy any electronics online.This was a first and I am so burned I'll not give A second chance.3/5/13 UPDATE>>> AMAZON HAS RESOLVED THIS TO MY SATISFACTION 100%.CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS EASY TO REACH AND I USED THE CHAT WINDOW TO RESOLVE THE RETURN BALANCE.This product was faulty, Kodak Wanted to make me wait for a return call past return date,Amazon returned it and promptly returned my money after verifying the return was received.Faith renewed. Thanks Again.
