This camera makes you wonder why Kodak is backing out of the business. I opened the box and without any problems, had the camera set-up and readdy to use in minutes. It is very intuitive and user friendly. Kodak is going to keep up support of these cameras so do not hesitate to buy one and enjoy the daylights out of it. Thie picture quality is wonderful and using my Easyshare printer makes this a no brainer for ease of use and printing. Buy one, you will not be sorry.
