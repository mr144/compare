I bought this camera to replace my old Kodak 5mp camera. Wow have these cameras advanced ! What brought me to the Z990 was the 30X optical zoom. It ROCKS !!! If you want a good camera that can reach out and capture wildlife this is a great choice. There's lots of awesome digital cameras out there to choose from. I am happy with my Kodak. It seems to be easy on batteries, takes a great picture and is easy to handle. If there is any downside it is that it does too much !!! I am now paying for poking fun at my parents for not knowing how to program their VCR !!!
