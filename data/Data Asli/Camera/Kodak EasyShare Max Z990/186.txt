I have to say that i am no camera expert. I am although a geek for electronics. I also love a great deal, Last year my niece got this for christmas, after playing with it for 5 minutes i wanted one. Juvenile i know but can you blame me? So i asked my sister how much it was and i was shocked that she only paid 245.00 for it. At which point i had made up my mind to get one. I just recently purchased this camera (a year later i know) for 180.00 and was so excited to get it. Ive had this kodak for about two weeks and have been walking all around taking pictures of everything. I think this camera is wonderful, it shoots great in low light and the zoom is pretty impressive. The only problem I have had with it is that the hrd mode can be a little tricky (this may be user error though) if you do not hold the camera perfectly still it wont capture the image. BUT for the price its really unbeatable full hd video recording (1080p) and magnificent pictures. If your in the market for a camera and do not want to spend 1,000 for the digital rebel go with this camera it wont let you down.
