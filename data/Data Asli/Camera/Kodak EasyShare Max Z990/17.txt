This camera does everything I was looking for in a digital and more.  I would have given it a higher rating but there is one problem which can be annoying; that is, it does take too long to &#34;chamber&#34; the picture once you take it and waiting to move on to take another one.  There is a delay which is way too long, especially if you are trying to continue taking pictures of sporting events, family functions, or anything which is a moving or continuing picture.  I have a few other digitals but this Kodak is the only one in my collection which is horrible in taking the shot and setting up for another one.  But for this issue the camera would be an awesome one.
