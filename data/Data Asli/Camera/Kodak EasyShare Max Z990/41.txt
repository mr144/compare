I have several point and shoots and do not want a DSLR.  But I wanted better sharper pictures especially in low light.  This camera is great and also has a good optical zoom.  Read this review: [...]In my experience it is great for parties at home or for pictures of kids ..., it has excellent low light capabilities.  Its pictures are much better than my Panasonic Lumix ZS3.  Flash is excellent.  The down side is it is very slow to start and slow between pictures.  I use the ZS3 when I need speed and the Z990 for good quality.  I could buy a DSLR such as the Canon T3i with 2 lenses that would be faster and give even better pictures ..., but $900+ is pricey and I would never bring it with me.  .
