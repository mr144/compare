I use my camera daily for work, also lots of travel and family photography. This camera has exceeded the need by a wide margin. The 'no stitch' panorama feature, AMAZING Schneider lens, 1080P videos, color rendition, light weight, common batteries (AAs), intuitive menu system, etc., really put this over the top. Get one while you can!
