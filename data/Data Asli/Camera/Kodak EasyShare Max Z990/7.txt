This is my 3rd Kodak EasyShare camera. Sadly this Z990 has turned out to be a huge disappointment for me.  I loved the my other 2 cameras, the most recent being a P712, the dock was great for both transferring photos and recharging the batteries, the cameras were easy to operate, and I got great photos.  The camera rested on the Kodak EasyShare dock and was always charged and ready to go.  I ESPECIALLY LOVED THE KODAK EASYSHARE SOFTWARE FOR EDITING MY PHOTOS, I used the software on almost every photo.  Unfortunately, the P712 quit working and I ordered this camera rather quickly. Since this Z990 comes with rechargeable batteries, I wrongly thought this camera would come with a template to fit the EasyShare dock for recharging the batteries like my other cameras.  The batteries are rechargeable, but you have to remove them from the camera, I find the battery cover is not so hard to open, but is very difficult to close again. In my opinion, it is quite inconvenient to have to remove the batteries for charging.  Also, this camera is extremely slow when taking more than one photo.  I have to wait about 10 seconds between each picture, so obviously I miss a lot of shots.  This happens even with brand new batteries.  However the worst thing (for me) is that this camera does not sync with the Kodak EasyShare software that is installed on my computer (from my other cameras). Although according to the the Kodak website it should sync with the new camera.  The Kodak website also states that 'EasyShare software is no longer available for download' and 'sorry for any inconvenience'.  If you are considering this camera,  I would definitely buy something else.
