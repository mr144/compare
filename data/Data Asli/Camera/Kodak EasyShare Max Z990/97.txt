The price, features and zoom beat out all of the competition.The big problem is it takes 20 seconds to process picture and return to ready.Shutter speed is slow, press button and sometimes the picture is gone before it takes the picture.Sometimes the flash does not go off at all when it should.Yes it has the latest firmware update 1.12 dated 2011-11 and I use 6 & 10 High Speed cards.Pressing the shutter button while waiting does not help.
