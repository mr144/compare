Absolutely awful camera! At first I thought it was just me getting used to the camera and all of the 'wonderful' features and lenses (even though this was not my first camera) By the time I figured out that it was not user error, I had had it to long to return, so looks like I am stuck with an expensive paperweight! All of the 'Creative mode' and 'artistic mode' features cannot be used as no matter what you do to steady the camera, you get the 'cannot be processed, hold camera steady' blah blah blah!! I gave up on even trying to use them. The smart capture does ok, provided your not worried about missing the shot due to the wait time between shots, and the zoom that is oh so slow, and sometimes just stops mid zoom. Battery life?? I thought maybe the 4 rechargeable batteries were old, so I bought brand new ones, then I though the charger was bad, so I threw it out and bought a new one....long story short, you could hook this thing up to a nuclear reactor and maybe get a couple dozen shots! As it is, fully charged batteries will get you 15-20 shots before you have to switch batteries for the next 15-20 shots, and regular AA batteries...forget it....two shots and the camera has eaten them for lunch!I was so excited to get this product, but I am very disappointed. Yes, its a good price, but you would be better off saving the money and paying more for a Nikon or Cannon. That is what I will be doing from now on!
