Well im not an expert on cameras or anything, but this one i have to say, is really amazingthe pictures in low light are incredible!the zoom is amazing!the fact that you can set on manual mode and play with all the different options of a pro camera like shutter speed, aperture, etc.. is really great to start learning how each aspect works and affects pictures!if you'r an already profesional photographer you might not need a camera like this, since the sensor is much more smaller than DSLRs.. but if you want to start and experiment all the greatness of a  huge optical zoom and nice picture quality, this is the way to go!ps: i did notice it goes slow sometimes when writting pictures hence the 4 stars!!i did also suggest you get a tripod if you plan on using zoom a lot.. without one it could be very annoying taking fully zoomed pictures, even tho the stabilization improves it a LOT, it stills moves when u have high zoom..
