My first two digitals were Kodak and then I switched to Canon but now am having trouble with the Canon so decided to get this one. It took a while to find the adjustments that I wanted for my photos as there's a lot to choose from even if you do not use the manual mode. Well with the moon at its closest and brightest last night I was happy with the shots I got with the zoom and oddly found the manual mode was the best for it. I hardly use the manual mode but I think I am going to be playing with it more with this camera! This one is not for you 'point and shoot' type users if you want to get that great colorful picture as I do find I am constantly changing between different settings to get great photos. I do love that I can get great action shots without going into the action features. That was true of my other two Kodaks, I could take great photos off the back of a moving motorcycle and I am sure I could take great snaps from the window of the car with this one (I no longer ride motorcycles)after getting a great shot of my horse going into a gallop from a standstill just this past week! This seller was prompt in sending the camera and it was decently packed.
