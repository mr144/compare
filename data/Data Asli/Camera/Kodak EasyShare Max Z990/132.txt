I bought this camera because I was looking for something with manual settings for great macro shots.  I was definitely not disappointed!  I love it!  Until now, I had been a point_and_shoot girl, and this is a great camera for you to get if you want to: a) move up from a point_and_shoot camera, b) learn to use manual camera settings without spending a fortune on a dSLR and lenses, and c) still own a camera that lets you take awesome point_and_shoot pictures.  Especially if you are just learning, it can take a while to learn how to adjust the manual settings, and if you are in a 'take a picture - NOW!' situation, it is nice to be able to still use this camera as a great point_and_shoot.First of all, if you are buying this because you think the $180-ish price tag is a great deal from Amazon's list price of $450, that's not quite right.  This camera retailed for somewhere around the mid-$300s range when it was introduced last year, so the savings on Amazon are good, but not as spectacular as Amazon leads you to believe.  That said, this camera is worth every bit of the $180 I paid for it, and then some.  Also, the lens on this thing is pretty big, so take that into consideration when you are buying a tripod (the lens shifts the center of gravity, and it will tip some tabletop tripods) and a camera bag.  Another thing that is a bit misleading is that the lens looks like it can be rotated to adjust the focus - but the lens on this camera is fixed!  The manual focus is adjustable via button settings ONLY.Now... on to the good news!  This camera captures AMAZING colors.  I found reports of some similar-level cameras doing weird things with bright purples, but this is not an issue with this camera.  The only thing that might suggest a problem with color levels is that I think the LCD screen tends to show colors on the images as overly bright, but when you download images to a computer and view them or print them, they look fine.The 30X optical zoom is incredible.  I call it my 'stalker lens' - I like to take pictures of outdoorsy things, and a zoom lens is invaluable when you are trying to sneak up on wildlife.  The resolution on the digital zoom is also high enough that if you have to utilize the digital zoom in addition to the optical zoom, the image quality is still pretty good.  I submitted a couple of photos to the gallery above - a brown anole (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo13YTLHFYK9UEY/B004FLL53Q/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link) and a redbellied turtle (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo30K4ISUUR2FXH/B004FLL53Q/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link).  The colors are great and the images are sharp, even though I took both of them in 'program' mode and only adjusted the focus.  The camera does a great job of compensating for lack of knowledge on the photographer's part!The macro mode and super macro mode are terrific.  I photograph small needlework items up close to show details, and I am actually a little cautious with macro mode because it shows EVERYTHING - not only my beautiful embroidery, but also lint and cat hair.  I posted an example to the image library (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1XJIQWWKTMCHA/B004FLL53Q/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link).The camera uses rechargeable AA batteries, which are nice because they are relatively inexpensive, but it would be nice to be able to plug in and charge the camera.  The battery life on the included batteries is good, though - about 100 pictures' worth.The HD video is surprisingly good, too.  I used this to take video at a high school graduation, and the camera did a good job of recognizing where the focus should be.  The videos are crisp and look great, and the sound is pretty good.Overall, I am not a real photographer, but if you are looking to hone your skills and learn more about photography, this is a great intermediate camera for you, especially at this price point.  I definitely recommend it!
