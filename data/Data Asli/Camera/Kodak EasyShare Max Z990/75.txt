So far I love this camera. Actually I bought it mostly for it is quality video and telephoto lens (in that order). I was not disappointed.Pros: Too numerous to mention (read the positive posts, I see no need to repeat everything that has already been posted).CON: I am sorry I did not buy 2 camera deals because my NEW camera was $179 but a couple days after I bought mine the price jumped over $120 !!!Buy this awesome camera!UPDATE:After using the Kodak Z990 for several days I have discovered it is rather noisy. It produces a chatter noise especially when in full zoom and the video picks it up.For the price of $179 with free delivery and plenty of rechargeable batteries I still think it is a deal.
