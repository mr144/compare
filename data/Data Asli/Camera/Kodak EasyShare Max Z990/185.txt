We are not professional photographers by any means.  This camera is super easy to use, and honestly can take pictures with no flash in near-dark conditions.  It's pretty amazing.  I used it recently to capture a picture of our baby sleeping in her crib for the first time!  I keep a blog, and my friends are constantly commenting about how crisp my pictures look and how bright the colors are.  We have not tested the panoramic settings, but we have put it on just about every other setting to see how the pictures look.  They are just about perfect every time!  The only thing I would mention is that you HAVE to give it time to focus, otherwise your photos will be blurry.  But honestly, I think that's the case with every camera.We love it, and we know people that have spent a lot more money on the Canon Rebel and other cameras like it, but our pictures are just as good if not better.I would recommend it in a heartbeat.
