The camera worked great for a year, but gradually the zoom would not respond readily.  It would not move at all or sometimes just move slightly and stop.  New batteries and recharging the present ones did not make a difference.  The camera has just become slow at turning on and off.  I really do not know where to send it since Kodak has gone out of business.We had a Kodak Easy Share before this with a docking station for recharging and we did not experience this problem.Sincerely,Sadly disappointed and frustrated
