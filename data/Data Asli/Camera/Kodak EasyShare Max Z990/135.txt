1) Very long time between shots. Atleast you have to wait for 20-30 seconds after taking the first picture before you can take the next one2) Had issues with the Flash , all of a sudden the flash was not closing, had to go through the painful process of working with the support3) Zoom does not work properly.I would suggest anyone to stay away from Kodak products.
