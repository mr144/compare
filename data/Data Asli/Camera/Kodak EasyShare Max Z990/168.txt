Yo-Have had this camera for about a week.  Am VERY happy with the performance, build quality, features and especially the low price for this great camera.  It has features of the far more expensive Canon and Nikon cameras for far less than half price!Picture quality is great.  Battery life is OK but carry spares in the carrying case that you have to get from Kodak.  I opted to get the three year warranty from SquareTrade with the handling and damage added feature for less than thirtytwo on a email special.The size, balance and use of rubberized 'grippy' material makes the handling a real delight.  If you turn off both the lcd and flash - your batteries will last much longer.  The camera comes with four rechargable batteries and a charger.  I suggest getting at least four more Eneloop AA rechargable batteries.
