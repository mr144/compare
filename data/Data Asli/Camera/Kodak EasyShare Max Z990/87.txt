I have owned this camera for about 5 months and find it extremely frustrating that my inexpensive old Kodak EasyShare C653, takes indoor photographs that far exceed this pricey Z990. I am not a novice at photography, yet no matter what settings are used, day or night, indoor photos are horrible and consistently grainy with the Z990, whereas the C653 takes perfect, high resolution indoor photos every single time.In my estimation, the Z990 is fine for outdoor in bright light or movies, but for indoor stills, it is absolutely useless and a complete waste of money.Buyer beware!
