This is a great camera crisp pictures but  unfortunately they quit servicing the camera and offering software or any help on it since 09-05-2012. since the software is no longer available for down loading to your computer I would caution your need? . Software is built in the camera, but if you need to get the software forget it.I have some real great pictures with this camera but the camera company went broke when their requirements for actual film stopped and they no longer sold it.It took a big end of game for Kodak. But The Camera is Great
