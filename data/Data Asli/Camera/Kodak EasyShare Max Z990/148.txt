I am no expert when it comes to cameras but I have to say, this is the best darn camera I have ever owned.  The 30x zoom is awesome.  I have been able to get some amazing bird shots up in the trees and some close up snake shots that I did not dare try to get any closer to.  It's pretty jumpy when you zoom out to the max, but if you use a tripod, you can still get an amazingly clear pic.  Low light pics are unbelievable as well.  Too many good features to go into here but I would highly recommend this to someone who is not an expert but wants to take pictures like one.  Oh yeah, and do not forget...it is got HD video!  Great camera!
