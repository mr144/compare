I just got a Kodak Z990 digital camera, and found instructions on the Kodak site to upgrade the firmware to the latest version. I have a memory card which I used, following instructions at Kodak.I followed the instructions but the camera never did indicate how to update the new firmware. I tried twice, erasing between times.The camera does not come up with installation instructions. So HOW do I get it off the memory card and into the camera?Please?
