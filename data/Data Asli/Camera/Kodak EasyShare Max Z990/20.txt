Bough this camera as a backup to my Cannon for a 30 day trip throughout Australia and Asia.  I liked so much that I ended using the Cannon as a backup and taking most of my pictures with the Kodak Z990.  It is so sensitive in low light conditions that you very seldom need to use the flash.  My only concern now is what has happened to Kodak and who is going to provide service.
