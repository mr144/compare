This camera gave excellent results at an indoor rock concert. The 30x optical and the high ISO ability was well beyond what you could normally expect for this price. I am seriously considering getting a spare.I bought a used one on eBay recently. The images are crisp as heck.I see some tendency to over-expose, and I find the build quality feels (but actually is not) cheap.Other than that, this is a powerhouse with a low price tag. Fool your Canon-snob friends!This becomes my go-everywhere camera. The DSL is resting comfortably.
