We are Kodak camera fans so this is the 4th camera we have owned by Kodak. It is by far our most favorite... everyone is always amazed at the quality of the pictures we get.. maybe it is the photographer but we think the camera is to blame. It has great features with the ability to take HD video. For the money it is a great camera
