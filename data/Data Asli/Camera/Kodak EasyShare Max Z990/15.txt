I bought this as a gift for my wife.  We took it on a driving vacation through Canada and New England.  To get the maximum out of its features, a tripod would be a necessity.  With a tripod, we were able to take some beautiful panoramic shots and use the hue saturation feature.  The zoom capacity exceeds our ability to keep distant items in frame easily.  This camera serves the vacation and event picture taking amateur photographer very well.  I can not justify the added expensive of getting a better camera than this for our needs.
