It is a slow camera. It does not have a sturdy solid feel. It has a flimsy cheap feel. I purchased it for sentimental reasons because Kodak is discontinuing their camera business as part of their bankruptcy reorganization. I like the radical zoom. I like the ISO 6400 sensor. I like the Nostalgic color film effects. I almost always use the Ektachrome choice, for Nostalgic color, because I like the extra color saturation, especially indoors with no flash but, I use that setting for outdoors too.I also like the scene modes. Since it is a slow camera, I shoot in 3 or 6 megapixal size. I use a Sandisk Extreme III Class 10 8GB SDHC card. I also updated the camera to the latest firmware. It is a fun camera and I use it for all my personal use, when I need to do semi-serious photography. It allows me to only use my Nikon DLSR for professional use, hopefully extending the life of my Nikon. The low price of this camera is what allows me to afford it and have fun with it.I am sure the Canon Powershot SX40 HS or the Nikon Coolpix L810 are much better digital bridge cameras but I can not afford them and I like Z990's Nostalgic color modes and simple scene mode choices and an ISO speed that is faster than 3200. When my Kodak Z990 and Z950 cameras become completely spent, I am going to' transition to Canon Powershot consumer cameras.
