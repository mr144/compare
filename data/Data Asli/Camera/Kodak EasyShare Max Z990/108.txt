After looking at reviews, and demos of pictures on YouTube, I bought this refurbished, discontinued camera from a dying company. But I have no regrets. It's easy to use on automatic, yet it has manual controls for everything. Easy to hold, and not too heavy. The zoom is just amazing, wide to tele. The sensitivity of the CMOS sensor is impressive. It's 12 MP, which is plenty unless you want to brag, or make wall-sized posters. The 'features' are a little hokey, I did rather do my fiddling on the computer. The HDR is subtle, and post-processing with two exposures could yield better true HDR images, but it has its uses. I leave it on for most still shots. The charger is cheap, inefficient and slow, so get a spare. The 24 page manual is just a tease, so download the full manual from Kodak. Standard USPS shipping only took 3 days.
