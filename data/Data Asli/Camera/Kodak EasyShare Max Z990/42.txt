This camera worked very well for the first couple of months.  Outdoor photos and photos in macro mode are great but forget about taking acceptable indoor photos of actual people.  Also, the battery life is very low and like other reviewers, the camera has started freezing up.  So much so, that I have to actually remove the batteries and put them back in to get the camera to respond.  The zoom while filming video is very loud during playback.  I have had Kodak cameras in the past but this one has become quite a disappointment!  Now I am looking for a new camera again...what a pain!
