First oFf I do not think Kodak pays reviewers to give them good reviews, they have been in business to long.1. I always read the 3 stars to 1 stars to make up my mind.2. The camera is not slow shot to shot just hit shutter button and you are out of reviewand ready to shot again.3. Video with great sound sabilization and 1080p, this rivales my play touch which I also own.4. Slow menus? no if you know what you are doing and setup your camera you will find adurejustmentsquick.5. Its a steal! I paid 159.99 at another store with free 8gig card and protection plan.6. I am so tired of kodak getting a bad review, I own top end and meduim end DSLR'S and I am aadavanced shooter for 8 years.7. Picture quality right under a DSLR and look greatI say ITS A BUY, AND KODAK KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
