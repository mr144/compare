This is by now after several months of trials my favorite camera, even though the pictures are recorded in the 'old' 4:3, not in widescreen format; works for me. The Schneider objective is nice, especially the optical zoom. Since my video camera was on the charger one day I tried the video app of the EasyShare camera, and boy was I surprised: HD picture quality, BUT absolutely no synced sound - the musician I took the video of grinned into my camera already after finishing a song, but the last notes were still lingering on the video - negative! But I shoot photos most of the time, and that is well done with this camera.
