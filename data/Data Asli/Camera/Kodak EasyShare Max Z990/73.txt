This is my second Easy Share Kodak camera.  It was very convenient to recharge the battery in my first Kodak camera on the Printer Dock so having to take out the batteries to recharge them in the Z990 is going backwards for me.  There are more features on the Z990 which thankfully  a class in the use of digital cameras at my community junior college has been most helpful.  For years I owned and used a Pentax camera with a built in light meter so depth of field, shutter speed etc. were part of the picture taking experience and equation.....and very time consuming.  The Z990 does all the calculations for you if you match up the choices given with your photo situation.  All the buttons, levers, are much easier to use than my 1st Kodak camera.  There was definitely thought behind the design of the Z990.  I have had to purchase a card reader to transfer pictures to my IMac computer.  The 1st Kodak camera could use the cable and transfer all pictures without taking out the card. VIEWFINDER----on sunny days I could not live without this necessary feature.  I do not crop and edit pictures in the camera. I edit the pictures on the computer and then either send them via email or print them on my Kodak printer.  I use the zoom frequently but have yet to use the &#34;video&#34; feature.  Overall---glad I purchased this camera.
