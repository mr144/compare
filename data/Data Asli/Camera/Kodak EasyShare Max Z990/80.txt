Loved it! Easy to use. Worth every cent. I am so not a photographer but I needed a camera with a lot of zoom for a concert I was going too. And I picked this one out of quite a lot of others. The zoom is amazing; from 150 feet I got close enough to get their tattoos with detail. I can not wait to figure out the other cool stuff that you can do with it.
