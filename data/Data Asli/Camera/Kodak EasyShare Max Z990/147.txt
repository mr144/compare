I have had this camera for a few months, and it is for the most just as advertised (and reviewed by folks here).  If you want to use it for the video side, you should just leave it stationary, as it can not keep up with moving objects.  I almost exclusively use it for filming musical acts at my radio station or at festivals, and it is great.  The ONE issue I have with it is it automatically turns off 28:31 every single time.  There is plenty of space left on my 16 gig card, so that's not it.  I can turn it back on and film for another 28:31 before it turns off again.  Perhaps there is a way to turn that feature off, as I have lost some awfully good material.  Other than that, I am very pleased with this camera.
