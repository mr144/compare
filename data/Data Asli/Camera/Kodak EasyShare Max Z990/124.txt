I ordered this on June 7 and got it a week later! This is a beautiful high zoom camera with a lot of settings to play with and great picture quality. I had to return my Fijufilm Finepix s4500 and replaced it with this Kodak Z990 after tons of research, and I could not be happier! When you zoom while taking a video it is smooth with no jerking (as with my previous camera) but you can hear the zoom noise in the video which is a minor downside for me. Overall, shipping time, total price, camera quality, I gave it 5 stars which I think it definately deserves.
