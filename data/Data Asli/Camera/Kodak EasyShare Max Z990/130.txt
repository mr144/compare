It's the cheapest you can find in his style preserving quality. Although Kodak decided to close its camera division continues to provide support to the products so they can buy with confidence.It has almost all features that a professional camera for beginner might have, except that the lens is fixed but you can take pictures very, very close and very, very far (even photograph the moon), the fixed lens 18-840mm is something that would cost thousands of dollars if interchangeable and further stabilization of the images to prevent blurring is at the lens, ie, the best stabilization there is!Most of the subject or scene modes works fine except for the HDR (very bad actually, well, you can not take a lot) do not be fooled by the results in this way, it is better to do with third party software.It is important that they learn to use the Kodak software as for photographs in portrait mode allows you to soften the face which is unbelievable functionality, the other functions are not good and it is better to use Adobe Light Room 3.X .It is light and very pleasing to the eye, does not support external flash (unless adapters with horrible I do not recommend) so the flash not going to help much.Shooting in RAW causes extreme slowness as if shots are fired simultaneously and yet the quality of it is practically the same. It is also important to update your software from the home page.The included batteries do not last long and it takes nine hours to charge using the charger that comes default in the box.In conclusion the best camera for beginners who can find!
