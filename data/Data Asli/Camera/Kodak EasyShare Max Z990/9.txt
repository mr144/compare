In a years time, I have had to send this camera to the Kodak repair center twice for the zoom lens...It just stopped working..Now I have issues with the camera wanting to change the settings around without me prompting to do so..Bad news is it is no longer in warranty. Paid way too much for this camera to somewhat work like I want it to for no longer than a year..Ive had 3 Kodak products prior to this one that worked just fine..This one not so much!
