I bought this camera the week before a once in a lifetime family vacation, It has most of the features a amateur could ever need. I have a collection of over 3000 slides I shot with my old Pentax ME Super so using various options is not intimidating to me. That said I wish I had gotten it a month beforehand so I could have learned more about how to use it. The first night we shot the moon over the desert as it peeked out of the clouds and our 6 20-something kids were freaked out not only that the camera could take such great shots but that the old man actually knew a little about photography. There are so many options that I have yet to explore from panoramic exposures to RAW image capturing and processing to HD movie capability to High Dynamic Range still photos and the list goes on. Greatly satisfied with my purchase. Got it for $170.
