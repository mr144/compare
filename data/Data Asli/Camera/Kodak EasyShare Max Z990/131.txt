Sooooo, I am not really photography savvy, but this camera makes me feel like a professional! I am still learning the ins and outs, as I only use this camera taking family pics around the house or when we go places.The effects are great.  (i havent read the user manual, so thats probably why I havent conquered every in and out)Its user friendly.  Beginner friendly.  Nice design and I enjoy the fact that when its sunny outside I can change to look only through the eye instead of at the LCD.There are so many great things I can say about the camera...it gets tons of compliments...and the look is waaaaaay better than the old school easy share.The only downside is when you want a low profile camera, this is not it.  It can be bulky sometimes where you would just prefer a small camera to toss in your purse and be on...but its worth the money.I do not regret my purchase and know that it will get better as I learn my camera more...I hope that if you buy one, you enjoy it as much as I do!
