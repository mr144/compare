after going through the reviews I ordered this camera from a different site 1SaleADay for 134$ and it turned out to be really good. Of course you can not compare against any Canon cameras but for the price , 30X zoom, and 12 Meg resolution it is really good. It records pretty good 1080p videos, but I switched to 720P resolution but it is good. Audio quality is really poor that is why I have to give one less star. BTW it does have Date stamp feature but it does not print the time where as my 5 year old Canon SD550 has that feature.There is no postcard size feature in this too, but my SD550 has that feature and image size will reduce to 400kb without loosing much quality where as in this all the image size are from 3Meg
