I purchased this camera (w/the bundle) from Amazon a few months ago, and I am quite pleased with it.  It has many great features like facial recognition, Easyshare, but the feature I love the most is the effects the camera provides for film enthusiasts.  It offers photo effects that mimic popular Kodak films such as T-Max, Tri-X, Kodacolor, Ektachrome, and, last but not least, Kodachrome!  I use these all the time.The camera is very sophisticated.  I like how the flash pops out if there is not enough light in the given situation.  I really recommend this camera.  Especially, since it is Kodak's last one.  : (
