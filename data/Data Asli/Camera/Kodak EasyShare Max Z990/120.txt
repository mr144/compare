Bought one at the beginning of June, 2012.  Took it to Four Corners, NM, AZ, UT, and CO.  Had no problems with an 8Gb class 10 (fast) SD card installed.  It took over 200 photos and several videos on the set of betteries that were included in the box.  For those not in the know, batteries of that capacity can take a number of hours to charge.  With the included charger, about 16.  You MUST have a fast SD card (class 6 or above) for any camera like this to save photos quickly.  I use only class 10 cards and it cycles very quickly.  Yes, it does take standard SD or SDHC cards.I liked the optics and features of this camera so much that I ended up buying yet another one on June 22.  Got them both for a very good price (thanks Kodak and Office Depot!).  I am sorry Kodak is getting out of the photo business after all of this time.All I can say is that it blows away my Fuji S1800 as far as low-light and taking photos in which the sun is almost in front (but not in the frame).  The Fuji's lens will flare purple in every instance (they were known for good optics, but apparently not with their cheap point and shoot cameras). Similar style to the Fuji, but this one's optics did not flare (at least I could not see any).  I did not point it directly at the sun to see if I could get it to, either.There is one con...the menus are rather non-intuitive.  On my previous Kodak from 2006 (similar design), the menu system was considerably better.  Still not used to this one.  I wanted to set the camera to take infinity shots and it was not obvious that the flower button on top would cycle through not only close-up settings, but its infinity focus setting, as well.  Guess I should have spent a little more time with the manual.All in all, if you can find one of these at a good price (I paid somewhat less than $150 each for these), go for it.  I do not think you'll be sorry.
