Slow to take a pic but took decent pics until about 6 months after purchase it started telling me lens was blocked. and turning it off and back on made it work for a while. but now it wont even turn on and its going to cost at least $125 to fix it if not more that's not including the shipping and handling.. I had always been quite pleased with Kodak Easyshare cameras till now..  I will probably switch to a Nikon or Canon when I get the money to replace this camera..
