First I would like to say that I like this camera. I purchased it before I knew Kodak would not be making cameras any longer. Having owned (and still have) the Kodak DX7440 Kodak digital with the Schneider-Kreuznach lens (as on the Z990)I knew their products produce great pictures.The focal length on the 990 is fantastic. The video mode is easy to use and makes good videos. Have not used a lot of the settings yet. But the ones I have tried work well and easy to set.Like having the option of using the Live View or looking through the view finder (saves battery power). So far it has not disappointed me with one exception..the battery life is fair..thus the 4 stars.The I-on lithium battery in the DX 7440 was much better and had a longer life and battery charger.Make sure if you buy this camera that you have extra batteries and a good battery charger. The one that comes with the camera is very slow.
