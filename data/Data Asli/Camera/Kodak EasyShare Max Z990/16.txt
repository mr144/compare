This camera goes well beyond the limitations of what a bridge camera would be expected, zoom is amazing even on video, low light ability with almost no grain. If you know how to adjust aperture and ISO you will rarely use the flash. Settings and menu are frustrating. You may miss a shot while trying to get that perfect setting or while the camera is processing high resolutions. Stereo Mic was the deal buster for me as I chose between this and the Fuji bridge.
