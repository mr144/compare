Deleted my other review after resolving problems. Not sure why, but when I was using it initially it was real glitchy, would not let me take a vertical shot for some reason, kept shutting itself off even when the battery meter read two-thirds full, etc. I used another set of rechargable batteries and it was fine--so, I guess the batteries which came with the camera were faulty. When I called Kodak, directly, they were the ones who told me that Li-ion AA's would not work with this camera, although another reviewer in response to my original post said they work fine. All that said, I guess my only real complaint about this product is that you cannot use it as a webcam.
