Bought this for the huge telephoto and other electronic features. However they built in so much electronics that it now responds like a Commodore 64 computer...slow! After taking a picture you have to wait a long time (in my opinion) before you can take another. Also the telephoto is not as responsive as I would like. Hard to fine tune. The pictures are good quality but these days that is almost a given. I would have only given this a 2 star but I see it is on sale and for the price is OK. I have 7 cameras, previously did photography as a business-now just a hobby but I'll probably go back to the Nikon and shelf the Kodak.
