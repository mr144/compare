Takes great photos and we love the zoom, we also like the fact it takes AA batteries as we can use regular batteries if we are in an emergency.  One problem with the camera however is that soemtimes (and its no respector of SD card sizes or brands) the preview pciture pane shows really wierd pixilated full spectrum colors other than the picture that you just took, however when you download the pcitures on the computer they are just fine.  All in all we love this camera, well for the most part anyway.
