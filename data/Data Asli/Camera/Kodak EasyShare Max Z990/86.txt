I bought the Kodak z990 camera last year and had nothing but trouble sence. There is no printed manual, only the online maunal which is not much help. For example: What is the RED led on the front of the camera. Sometimes it goes on! Do not look in the online maunal because there is nothing there about ANY RED led on the front of the camera. Also I can no longer transfer the pictures taked to my computer. It used to work automatic when the camera was connected.The camera has some very good features like the 30X zoom but after all the troubleI have had I would have purchased a better camera. (One with a printed manual)
