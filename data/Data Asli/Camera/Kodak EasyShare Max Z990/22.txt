PROS:- Great optics for the price- Great zoom. A little (1 or 2 steps) digital zoom helps, too much will ruin your pics.- Fast Saving & processing in shot-to-shot.- Impressive HD burst mode, very fast. You can have some fun with this.CONS:- Slow write in burst mode- Panorama not accurate enough, I prefer to take the pictures and then use HUGIN- Little apperture interval, from f2.8 to f8 max- HOLLY S*** THIS CAMERA DOES NOT HAVE CUSTOM WHITE BALANCE!!!!! this can be a pain in the ass, considering that low end portable cameras features this like BenQ.- The value charger can be better, 220mah??? come on kodak, i have a 400 mah targus charger that cost the half of its price....OK's:- Medium Battery life. Keep a fresh and fully charged set at hand while going outdoors or a long trip.- Accurate Image Stabilization, but not infallible, use tripod at full zoom.- Fast motorized zoom while step-zooming, but in reverse this camera make a anoying stop.- Beacuse its optics, if you are not zooming, you should be using the fisrt plane mode (flower) for anything between the you and 1 meter... It will take better pictures that way... Autofocus stinks on less than 1 meter.TRICK:- For the shot-to-shot slowness, (no burst mode, only manual shot-to-shot) i have discovered the following: disable the disp mode and only leave the basic icons (using DISP button), focus with light pressing the shutter, shot and depress the shutter, immediately light press the shutter and the cammera will be in capture mode avoiding the preview, no matter the resolution you set. It's not difficult to get used to this.Why 4 stars?? because this great camera, with great functions DOES NOT HAVE CUSTOM WHITE BALANCE and that dissapointed me, the burst mode slowness and the slow autofocus. But for the price is a great camera.I seriously recommend this camera for amateurs like me, that want something better that a portable but cheaper than a DSLR.
