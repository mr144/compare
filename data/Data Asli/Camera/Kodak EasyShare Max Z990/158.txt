Glad I picked this up. I took it to a Saturday class at a local collage for digital camera for beginers. I learn so much about takeing better picture and the use of the manual setting. This camera will teach me what I can do take good pictures with such little investment.I am sure in the next year or so I will step up and buy a DSL but for now this Z990 will show me the ropes. It turly is sad that Kodak is no longer making Cameras. This was there flagship and what a way to leave the business.Sorry to see it go.
