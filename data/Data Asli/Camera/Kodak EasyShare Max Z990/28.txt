As a camera it is a little bit slow, but takes good pictures. The pre-set scenes are well defined and easy to use...The HD video it makes is high quality.The bundle is also OK. Instead of 1 I got 2 packs of batteries (and all 8 is good) there was the USB cable as well (was not in description/photo)I am happy to have made this purchase - although my price back then was lower than current.
