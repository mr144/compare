When this camera works, it works GREAT! The image stabilizer is unbelievable when in full zoom and I have taken dozens of perfect shots from very far away. Also, as many others have commented, the low-light pictures are freaky good. I have taken it on several trips and came back with excellent shots! (one trip abroad and another to Montana where I got amazing wildlife pictures)However, I decided to sell my Kodak Z990 because the camera is not reliable. I have experienced many glitchy delays and had to wait a few minutes between shots to wait for the camera to catch up. The zoom is especially buggy, it can get stuck extended or absolutely refuse to zoom in. I have the high speed memory card and keep freshly charged Kodak batteries but it is still too frustrating to live with. Using the Kodak brand rechargeables that it comes with tends to help but I am going to turn this one in and wait for Kodak to give us a camera with all the good of this one but fix the bad.In summary: great start of a camera at a good price, but just too many delays and bugs so hopefully Kodak can clean it up
