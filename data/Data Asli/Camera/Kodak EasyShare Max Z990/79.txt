Before I bought this camera I had only used the little point and shoot cameras with the display screen on back and had a terrible time getting my shot right. The Z990 with its electronic view finder allows me to steady the camera with my arms against my body like when I shot with the old fashion 35 mm SLRs in days of yore. There are a lot of features I have not tried yet, but so far it has given me the pics I wanted. There have been some missed shots due to human error, but I hope to get past that learning curve soon.
