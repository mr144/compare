I love this camera, I bought it off craigslist from someone who bought it from here. They had hardly used it and needed the money. I bought it with the 15-55mm kit lens, I believe that's the one. I left some of my favorite pictures on here so hopefully you will be able to see the beautiful professional pictures I was able to get with this camera, even with the kit lens. Any questions, please feel free to ask.I have owned this camera about about 2-3 months now.
