After years of frustration with Point and Shoots I took a big step forward and purchased T3i with 18-55 Lens. Within 5 minutes of opening the box I was taking pictures. It took me couple of days to get adjusted to its size and weight. I have used the camera a lot for 10 days now with several manual settings. So far I am quite impressed with picture quality but not amazed. I thought camera should take better pictures. That could be due to the fact that I am new to DSLRs and also the included Kit Lens has some limitations. I may buy the nifty fifty and see how good the pictures turn out.UPDATE - Changing the rating to 5 stars. Amazing camera. The only regret I have is purchasing it with 18-55 mm lens. I should have purchased body only. 18-55 is good for nothing lens. I ended up buying 55-250 zoom lens which is awesome and 40 mm STM which perfect for closeup shots and videos. Nifty fifty was extremely poor quality.
