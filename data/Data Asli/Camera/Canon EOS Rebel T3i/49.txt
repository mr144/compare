I love this camera so far. I am new to DSLR, but find it very easy to use. From my understanding the lens is really no good compared to others, but I am ok with it.  It still takes much better photos than my point and shoot and is an inexpensive way to go to get a feel of the camera and the manual settings before upgrading to something better (which I plan on doing eventually).  Needless to say, I am a happy customer!
