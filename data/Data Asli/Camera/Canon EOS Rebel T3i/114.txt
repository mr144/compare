I am writing this review not because I purchased t3i but because I purchased 6D. I have had t3i for 2 years and must have taken over 50,000 pictures if not more. I decided to 'upgrade' and got myself 6D for 2.5K. And guess what? I do not any SIGNIFICANT improvement over t3i. What do I see is how light and easy to use t3i is. I am sure a 2.5K is much better than t3i. It has to be. However, for the amateur photographer who just likes to shoot pictures of his kids, friends, vacation sights t3i is the best camera. I will still probably keep 6D and use t3i.
