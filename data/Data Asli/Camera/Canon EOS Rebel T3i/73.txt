I though all digital cameras around 10 megapixels would be the same. No way this baby is amazing our 10 month old son looks so much better on this than with any other digital camera we have ever owned. That includes some of the canon mid rang units like the s10.It is Rey easy to use on auto, but also has millions of custom options which we are still learning. I would absolutely recommend this camera to friends and family.
