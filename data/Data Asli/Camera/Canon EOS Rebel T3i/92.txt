I am not a photographer, maybe someday I'll learn how it all works. What I really know is that I want to remember me 18 month old son just like he is today, 20 years from now. I was tired of fuzzy camera phone pics and carrying around a little digital camera that was only marginally better than a phone seemed like a waste. The Canon just works, I point at what I want to remember, push a button and it is mine forever, period. The colors are accurate, the lines are crisp, the detail is unbelievable. It's just stupid how well this little marvel does it is job. For me, this purchase was worth it is weight in gold because I do not miss the right moment now.
