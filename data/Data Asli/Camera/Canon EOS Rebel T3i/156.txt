I am a videographer, who was looking to move from standard def, and resisted the notion of shooting video with dslrs for some time, eventually after some research i decided to go for it and chose the Rebel T3i because of its features and cost and having seen what could be done with it, i was sold. the delivery time was amazing with my Amazon Prime trial membership and its performance in the first gig i used it for validated my purchase decision, there was no way i would get such beautiful video from  any camcorder in this price range, I am now looking to invest in glass (a 50mm f1.8 to begin with)  to really get the most out of my new favorite piece of tech, many thanks Amazon !
