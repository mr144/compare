After having my Sony camera stolen, I searched a long time for something that was similar to it.  I went with this camera even though the reviews were pretty mixed.  I love it!!! I use it to take pictures of my kids and husband, both of which are action shots.  I use it at family functions, in low light, outside...just everywhere.  And it never fails me.  Do not know how this would work for a professional photographer...but for a mother, wife and memory catcher, it works perfectly!!!
