I love this camera, I recommend it for honestly anyone, like I am 14 and I love it, I know a junior in highschool that has it and loves it, and I know an adult in her 30's that loves it! Anyone would be happy with it. It's easy to figure out and comes with easy reading directions and tips. It's awesome and the pictures on your camera are easy to upload to your computer, if you are looking for a nice camera, this is the one!
