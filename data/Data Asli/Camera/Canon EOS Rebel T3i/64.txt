I went to Central Europe last year and was not impressed with the old camera I was using. Then, I bought the Rebel T3i based on recommendations from YouTube.I absolutely love it. I am not a professional photographer but the shots I get from the T3i looks amazing. My friends thought that the shots were made by a professional.Very pleased with the results.
