just sold my T3 to get this model and am loving every minute with this new version. with all the new features on this compared to the T3 is amazing. The flip out screen is awesome, not to mention that the resolution is like 4x what the screen was on the T3. 18 megapixels instead of 12, better build quality with rubber accents, better sd card placement and external mic.I am not using this camera for any Videos and not sure why anyone would but that another story. I would highly recommend this tho the beginner or the intermediate photographer. has the same sensor and some of the more upgraded Canon's and some of the newer one's like the T4i.All you need is a few better lenes and you are on your way to some great pictures and fun. Best purchase I have made in some time and would recommend getting it on Amazon for the price and shipping prices are much better than I have seen from most other sites.
