I read quite a lot of the reviews on this product and was filled with much confidence when ordering that this was the camera for me! Unfortunately the auto focus could never, ever focus on anything. I mainly want to use the camera for pictures of my professional cakes and my pets.The images I did manage to get were much lower quality than I was expecting.When trying to photograph my hamsters the focus just kept trying, and trying, and trying, and trying...it could never focus on anything and would miss lots of great shots. When it finally decided to focus everything was blurry. Rubbish.I tried to test the focus using the macro mode, where the instruction booklet tells you to get as close as possible to the subject - I chose to photograph a flower in a vase. The stupid thing could not focus on the flower. I was not even able to take one photo. Not one!I am not expecting the world's best DSLR for this price, but I do expect to actually be able to take photos.
