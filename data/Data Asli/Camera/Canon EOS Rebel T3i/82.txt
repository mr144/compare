I am not a professional... I just like taking pictures of my kids and occasionally my friend's kids. The quality of pictures is amazing for someone who does not have any idea what she is doing, and to me that is all that matters. I read the reviews, decided to give it a try, and fell in love with the camera. My kids are only little once and I wanted amazing pictures of them to capture their youth and this camera achieves that. It very simple to use.
