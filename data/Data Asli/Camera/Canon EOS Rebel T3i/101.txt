Great price for a wonderful camera with so many features.The main issue I have with this camera is with the video; autofocus does not work in video.  You could press the shutter button to refocus but that messes up the few seconds of video.  There is also no good way to add a good mic because there is a problem with the automatic gain control so if you use an external mic, you will notice a hiss when there is silence in the recording.So T4i is out now.  This camera will be cheap soon and you should get it but only if video is not that important.
