I researched several SLR's before deciding on the Canon T3i. I am happy with my choice so far, having purchased the camera first of all to take high quality photos of fairly small works of sculpture art, using the Canon lens.Reliable, was delivered in terms of time and works perfectly, I recommend this product and its selling at 100%
