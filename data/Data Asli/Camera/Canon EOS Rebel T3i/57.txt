I bought the Canon 600D (T3i) for film making so I rarely ever use it to take picture. The T3i is a great HDSLR camera for beginers. The plus side of this camera is that you can install the &#34;Magic Lantern&#34; custom firmware to get more functionality out of the camera (follow focus, timelapse, HDR recording, rack focus, etc...).The only downside of this camera is no 60fps recording at 1080p but if you need that then you could buy the newer version T4i or the T5i.
