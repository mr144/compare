This camera replaced a Canon Rebel 35mm. It is surprising how similiar they are. So far it works GREAT. Only had the camera for a few days so this is not a far review.  The weight and balance is right on. I like the features. I can not believe for the sale price of the item, It does not come with a memory card. It works great with my old lenses. The shipping service from Amazon was excellent , order one day get it the next for free. Nice camera.
