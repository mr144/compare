I liked the Pro-shot a lot but it was getting on in age and then I left it in a restaurant in Alabama and of course no one had any knowledge about the missing camera. I had been looking at a Rebel for some time. I read Consumers Report on cameras and that helped me get this particular model. I love the big screen to view what I had taken and the 18 Megapixels really give a sharp photo.I was disappointed that Canon did not include how to connect the camera to a computer in the instruction manual. I am always nervous when trying something electrical without instructions. I really did not want to fry my new purchase. Everything came up roses and now I am getting ready to really work it over on a long trip to Europe. Thanks, Kerald Yearns
