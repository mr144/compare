I am just starting to develop my skills (or not) as an amateur photographer, and this camara is an excelent tool to start with. It is really easy to use, very intuitive, fast, light ( for been a reflex), the battery has never let me down, The only thing is that you may be a bit short with the lens, but is just a detail.I am realy happy with my new camara.
