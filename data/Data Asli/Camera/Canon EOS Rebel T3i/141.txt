This is everything I have ever wanted in a camera. When this came in the mail it was like Christmas and my birthday all rolled into one. I had originally looked at the T3 but upgraded to the T3i for more features. The T3i also has grips on the camera making it MUCH more comfortable to hold for long periods of time. I was happy that it came with so many different cords to hook up to my various other electronics.The SINGLE downside to this camera is that it has no internal memory. You have to have an SD card in it to use it. But really, that's not big deal. I bought 2. They are really cheap.
