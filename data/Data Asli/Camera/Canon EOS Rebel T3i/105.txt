This camera is my first DSLR camera and I am impressed every time I use it. This camera make me look like a professional photographer. Easy to use standard settings as well as the ability to create custom setting for the enthusiast. The included Lens takes amazing close up photos because of its included images stabilization. I would buy this again and again. Worth every penny!!!
