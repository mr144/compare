I bought this camera primarily for shooting independent films and it is fantastic. The quality is crystal clear and the weight and size make it perfect for getting in tight, small places very discreetly. I have used it to record some footage and do some time lapse videos and it is astounding me how well they are coming out.I did have a problem briefly at the beginning with video recording. It would stop after a few seconds and display the error message &#34;recording stopped automatically&#34;, but after buying a Sandisk 32GB Class 10 SDHC card ($19.99) I have not had the problem since.All in all, this is a fantastic camera for the price. Highly recommended.
