The T3i has everything a photographer or filmmaker is looking for in an entry-level DSLR.  Great interchangeable lenses, kit lens with decent aperture settings, awesome quality video, manual control over everything, and much more.  I absolutely love this camera for everything.  In my opinion, this is a better buy than the T4i unless you need a touchscreen or automatic autofocus.
