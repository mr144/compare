Overall good performance. Built in flash disappointing. Auto focus performs poorly in low lighting situations. Will be buying a real flash which hopefully will improve results. This is a complex camera and will take a learning curve to determine what it can really do.  With the 18-135 lens you do not really need a telephoto because the 18 MP allows severe cropping with little loss of image quality.
