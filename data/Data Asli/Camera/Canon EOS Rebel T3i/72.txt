This was my first try on any DSLR camera. Had the T2i for my brother last year and used it for a bit. But not a complete go through.After a thorough research on all Canon cameras out there (did not try nikon as out of budget), preferred this over some higher ends and better prices compared to the lower end ones.Pros: Good picture quality, great lenses available (using 18-55 and 55-250mm IS II), Good screen functions, Great manual functionality.Cons: A bit on the heavier side, Body looks a bit dull but is solid, Some settings not available as compared to some higher versions(which is not actually a con but i felt they could have added it)Requirements: A tripod, External Flash (if clicking many night photos), Remote controller...Get these get better picture qualities.All-in-all a good product at a great price...
