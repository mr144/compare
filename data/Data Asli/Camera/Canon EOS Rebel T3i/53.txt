I have had several digital cameras but this is my first DSLR. I bought it on recommendation of a friend who has much experience with photography. I wish I had purchased a bundle with a macro lens because close ups are my favorite and the standard lens does not let me get the really closeup pictures. It's easy to use and easy to learn.The only down side for me is that the software is not supported by my Mac Book Pro yet so I can not use the software that came with the camera.
