I just got this in the mail and, honestly, I have not even gotten it completely out of the box yet.  I have had a Rebel XT for some years now and decided to upgrade simply because of the new advances in technology and the fact that I know the XT was pretty much bottom-of-the-line.  I am sure I'll love the T3i just as much as I love my XT.HOWEVER: The first thing I notice while unpacking it is that the battery charger now comes with a CORD!  Really?  This was necessary?  It may not seem like much but for someone who travels, this cord is going to be a pain in the a**.  Why is it that every time manufacturers get something right, they feel it necessary to change it? Usually for the worse.  Perhaps someone can enlighten me.
