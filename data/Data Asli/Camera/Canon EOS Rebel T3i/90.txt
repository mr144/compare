I love my camera. The funny thing about this purchase is that I used to be an avid photographer. Got paid for photos that I loved taking...I mean...how amazing is that? But life caught up to my dream world and sadly I had to sell off my equipment. Most people might think that this would be a downgrade from my past cameras but the funny thing about photography is, if you have a camera, you have all that you need.This camera does everything I need it to do. The sensor might not be a full frame but I make up for it by using higher quality lenses.The video capabilities are great.The one thing I would have to say, as a word of wisdom is...buy a cheaper body that will do everything you need it to do (minimum). And invest in GREAT lenses. I cannot explain, express, or put into English HOW important a GREAT lens is.So if I could say buy it? 5 out or 5
