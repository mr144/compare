This is a great camera, and is amazingly simple to use. This was my first time buying a DSLR. It was for my sister who had no experience using a DSLR before. We used it in manual mode, and were able to use it well after a week of practice.I did definitely suggesting getting the 18-135 instead of the standard 18-55, even if you get the 55-200 as a separate lens. It is always better to have one lens, and not have to keep interchanging lenses. A great starter lens.I also got a 50mm lens along with the 18-135 for taking portraits.
