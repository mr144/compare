We bought this camera about 2 months ago from Canon while all the refurbished cameras were on sale.  I have to say, for what seemed prior to be something complicated, my wife and I were EXTREMELY pleased with the ease of use.  While we certainly don'y stray to far from the 'auto' set on the dial, every setting comes with a good description, and the camera is so intuitive when we use it.  The autofocus settings are great and the quality of pictures taken are absolutely INCREDIBLE.  We have been in the market for a DSLR for some time and went with a Canon over a Nikon on the advice of  a friend and I can say that we are EXTREMELY happy with our decision.  For anyone looking for a good starter DSLR, this camera is PERFECT. Capable of professional quality pictures with novice level user knowledge!
