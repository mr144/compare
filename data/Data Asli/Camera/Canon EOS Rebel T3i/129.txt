I bought this camera just a few days ago and so far am very impressed with its low-light abilities. I do not even have to use the flash indoors at night! I think this is a wonderful camera. The colors captured are very true to life, and with the flash it seems to get pretty crisp results. I definitely recommend this camera. I do not know about sports or intense action shots yet, I read from Cnet.com that it may not perform well in those areas, but we shall see! I do notice that it is MUCH slower in the Live View mode, so I have been just looking through the ancient peep-hole, and it is very quick!
