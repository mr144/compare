I bought this as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. But she broke up with me a week before Christmas but I still gave it to her. I never got to know how she liked it or even see pictures she took with it. I later found out it was stolen after taken a photography class. It was stolen from the car of the guy she was cheating on me with. I guess she do not care cause she was not the one who spent $700 on it and did not spend on a Christmas present for me anyway. I wish I kept it. It look like a good camera just by holding it. I just wish I could have used it and give a more detailed review.
