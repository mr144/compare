This is a replacment for an old camrea I had. The pictures are incrediably impressive and if you read the manual, which from the reviews some have not, you will find that this camera will create some of the most amazing pictures. If I had to nit pick anything on the camera, I would have to say that the lens cap should have a tie connected to it as I almost lost the lens cap twice.
