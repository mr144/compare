I am a beginner, and from everything I read on a great starter camera, this has been it and more. I started taking a lot of Portraits and people cant believe they are not professional taken. The quality is amazing. I ould recommend getting a better snap on lense such as the 55mm for portraits but this is a very easy user friendly camera for DSLR. Would buy again
