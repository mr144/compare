this is my third canon camera....two were small digital cameras but this is my first digital SLR and after using it a week Ifind I am getting excellent results ....still learning where all the buttons are but no complaints. The battery lasts a long timeand I purshased an extra and find this keeps me always ready to take a picture...It is light weight too and that is nice.
