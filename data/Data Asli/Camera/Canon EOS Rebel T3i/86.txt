I was tired of the shoots and needed a camera I can depend on to catch my kids teams in action. Well the first weekend I got this camera, I could not believe the quality of the photos it could take. I spent the weekend experimenting and I could not be happier with the  quality of the still shots.  beautifully clear and richer than anything that I have gotten from a shoot and the ability of this camera to capture action shots is stunning thank you Canpn
