Hey guys, I am sure if you were as excited about your DSLR purchase as I was, I am not the first review you have read. So let me keep it short and simple.If you are new, this camera with a kit lens is NOT going to disappoint. There's so much to learn on it right off the bat that you will not notice any of the things more experienced photographers might complain about (then again, you are spending way less too!). Excellent pictures. Excellent videos. As one reviewer put it 99% of people looking at your photos are going to see a beautiful picture. The other 1% are professional photographers who are nitpicking things you do not care about or notice.Camera takes brilliant pictures in auto, and even more brilliant pictures once you learn you play around with the settings. If you are trying to decide between this and another camera, do what I did. Write down what you want. Then go watch review videos with a pad and paper. Write pros and cons of each, then see what works best for you. I was comparing to the Nikon D5100 and found that since I want to do more with video, I wanted this for its better manual video and audio controls. While the 5100 has somewhat of a continuous autofocus, many complain that it does not give you much control and I find the T3i manual focus a breeze to use in video. Allows you to get more creative too.Anyway, whatever you decide, the Nikon and Canon DSLRs are all great cameras. Write down what you want your camera for, write pros and cons of each camera, quit stressing, order, and start shooting!Good luck!
