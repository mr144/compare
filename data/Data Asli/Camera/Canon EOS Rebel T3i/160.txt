The Canon T3i is the perfect  amy first camera' for a beginner photographer. Its easy to use interface makes finding and switching settings a breeze.The Canon t3i has an nice amount of weight here you know its not cheaply built but not to the point you want to carry it around. The tilt lcd screen is also a great attention to it letting you shoot from all angle without worrying about if your lined up or not. The only problem i received from  this camera was a battery back that does not charge fully
