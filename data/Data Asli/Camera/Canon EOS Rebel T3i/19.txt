I have never had a single issue with this camera and have just recently expanded out my accessories with a 430EX II flash and a Custom Brackets folding flash mount. I have used the stock 18-55 and 55-250 kit lenses since I purchased brand new and have taken some awesome pictures. I plan on expanding soon to some better lenses as I learn more but so far this cropped sensor body has been great. I have even done a few video projects with it that have come out looking great. If you are looking to buy new right now, you can not go wrong with an older inventory T3i and save a few dollars over the T4i or T5i, as they are all basically the same for general features.
