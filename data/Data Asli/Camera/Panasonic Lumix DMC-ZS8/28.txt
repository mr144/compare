Camera is perfect! (Got this for my husband) He used it during a hunting trip and although it was not a very successful hunt, from his tree-stand he did get a great zoomed in picture of a bright red cardinal foraging for food in a sea of brown leaves.... We would definitely recommend this camera! (definitely makes me want to replace my not so old camera with a Panasonic!)
