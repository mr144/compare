I love, love, love this camera.  It is so easy to use, pretty much point & shoot and the results are super.  It is small and light weight so I can drop it in my purse and not be weighed down. I really like the wide angle lens.  I mainly use the camera to take pictures of properties that we have listed for sale and upload the pics to the various web sites on the internet.  This is one of the best cameras I have found that serves my purpose.
