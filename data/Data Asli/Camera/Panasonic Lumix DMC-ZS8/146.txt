I had been a believer in Canon point & shoot products until my last purchase of a Canon Powershot SD780 IS Elph 12MP. I also owned the previous Canon Powershot Elph in 8MP which was much faster, great auto mode, superb video even in night shooting. I was completely disappointed with the SD780 not being user friendly needing tweaks here and there, video specially at night was bad which the prior 8MP Canon did without problem. Hence, my switch to the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8 which has none of these problems! The auto mode takes wonderful pictures and the flash at night is much better not washing out the entire photo or taking away color. Even without the flash in low light the photos are great and the stabilization helps to not blurr the photos! The night video is better than the SD780 and comparable to the prior Canon 8MP. I have a friend who is a professional photographer who suggested the Lumix and I could not be happier. I am using a Duracell High Speed Card 32 GB Class 10 Card. There is very little lag time between shots even in burst mode. The 16x wide angle Lieca lens takes much fuller photos. The Lumix gets a better background photo and much more depth. What stood out in the Canon Elphs were the vivid colors and crisp photos but so does the Lumix. The only negatives so far are with the zoom lens at distance. It seems to take longer to acquire autofocus because of the distance. So if you wanted to take a photo quick that requires long zoom, you might miss the shot because the autofocus will take a few seconds to acquire. Battery life is also comparable to the Canon. I can only assume Canon got cheap with their processor on the latest Elph series.
