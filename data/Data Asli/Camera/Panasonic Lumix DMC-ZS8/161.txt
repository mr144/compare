I have had a few digital cameras, but I wanted one with more zoom - and this one has it.  Great zoom.BUT I underestimated how useful the 'wide-angle' lens is - Had I known how much better many photos can be with a wide angle lens, I would have gotten one sooner.  With both a great zoom and a wide-angle, this camera does it all for me.  And for all that it does, it is still small enough to be easy to carry.  My wife liked it so much, that she bought one too - she's a realtor and says it takes great indoor wide-angle photos that are as good as another realtor's $5000 camera.
