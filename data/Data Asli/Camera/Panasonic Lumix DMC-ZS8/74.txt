After a little over a year of use this camera is falling apart.  Dust on the sensor is a constant problem, and this appears to be a known issue, though Panasonic continues to sell these. As soon as the sensor is contaminated, auto focus stops working, requiring a disassembly and a compressed air cleaning of the CCD.  It is not long until the contamination returns. There seems to be a direct path for the dust to enter, through the lens assembly. On initial disassembly for cleaning, I found there is no barrier between the environment and the CCD sensor.  Some sort of cost cutting measure? Lens errors are starting now as well, and I expect total failure of the lens drive soon. One year of moderate use before failure is not acceptable for a digital camera. Image quality of the 14.1MP CCD does not seem as good as my old 10MP Canon. Wasted money.
