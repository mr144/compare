I have had this camera for about 6 weeks now.  Overall it is not a bad camera and I am surprised by the depth of field it gives for a compact.  However it always uses slow shutter speeds. Even in bright light when I would expect the minimum shutter speed necessary to be around 1/250 of a second, this camera selects 1/80th. On manual I tried setting the minimum shutter speed to 1/125 but the results were just a dark image of little value. It's not really a problem for taking shots of buildings or other static objects but I spend a lot of time in the woods and frequently see birds and wildlife such as deer, snakes and groundhogs amongst others that I did like to photo. For this purpose the slow shutter speeds make the camera a poor choice.
