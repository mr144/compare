I have had three Panasonic digitals--my FZ5 from 2003 still works beautifully, but is too large to carry in my pocket and only works on a 1 mg SD car; I dropped my pocketable TZ5 and my LZ7 was lost in a snowbank until Spring.  So I bought this ZS8.  I am entirely satisfied; if I am careful--and I plan to be--I will not drop it or lose it in a snowbank.  Best features: 16x zoom; easy, fully intuitive and accessible controls; long-lived lithium, rechargeable battery; convenient size; video mode; excellent playback.  What I wish were even better:  sharper images (I am not complaining; with a bit of tweaking on Picasa, almost every picture can become better, and I have taken many without any tweaking that are excellent); even more powerful flash.  At $190 when I bought it on Amazon.com, this camera was a great buy and serves me very well!
