This re-seller is guaranteeing the camera for 30 days only and after that a customer is expected to shell out money once again to purchase another camera. I rarely used this camera, yet it is time to replace it only after two years. There is a dark speck appearing in the display. When googling if other people had experienced the same problem, the answer was yes. It appears that some dust matter got inside the camera. If the camera is sealed properly, no outside matter should get in there. I still do not know if that's indeed is the issue, but it seems that's the case. I am very disappointed that Abes of Maine Cameras and Electronics did not offer to replace this camera or to repair and instead, I am being told to contact Panasonic. I will contact my credit card and I will dispute the charges. I will never buy anything that has this vendor's name as a reseller.
