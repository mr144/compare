I love this camera! In fact, I have purchased two so far. But my review is to call attention to the fact that I bought one in March for 179.99. 5 days ago I wanted another one and the price was 194.99. Seemd strange since electronics prices usually go down, not up. But that was the best I could find on Amazon. So I bought it and 3 days later found the price had dropped to 179.99. I contacted Amazon and to their credit, they refunded to me the 15.00 difference. Two days later, today, I saw an ad for the camera on a news site and it is now 149.99! I love Amazon, they often ship to Alaska for free which others rarely do, but I can not understand why the price keeps changing around.
