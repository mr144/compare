I looked online to find out if this was Mac compatible and could not find out; but it is.  I previously owned a Lumix FS15 which I loved until it got dust inside.  It was Mac compatible.  Although Amazon does not list compatibility requirements for the camera, the box clearly says Windows 7; nevertheless it does not even need the card reader and works fine..  It has a lot of settings which is both good and bad.  The FS15 was easier for me to set up for taking low light pictures with movement.  I do not know much about cameras, so having a lot of choices is not necessarily better for me.
