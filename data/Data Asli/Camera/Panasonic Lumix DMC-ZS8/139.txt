I love this camera! I am taking more and better photos than I ever have before. I have not found anything negative to say about this camera yet. The only way to make it any better for would be to sell it cheaper. The HD video is stunningly good, easy to use and the zoom operates in HD movie mode. The big zoom allows me to get close, and the high resolution allows me use the editing software to zoom in even more with amazingly good results. Only a professional photographer could find this camera lacking. The battery life is very good, I have never come close to running the battery down.  If you want a camera that you can just power up and shoot, set this one to Intelligent Auto and start shooting. Even the auto timer works well. The menu system is easy to use. The video quality is better than any camcorder I have ever owned. This camera is a winner.
