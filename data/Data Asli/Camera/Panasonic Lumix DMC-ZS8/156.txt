Just got back from vacation and had purchased this camera a month prior to replace an older Lumix my daughter had accidentally broken. I will not go into all the technical details since it seems all this has been covered sufficiently by others. I will say that this camera took excellent quality pictures and was easy to use. I love the 16x zoom and was able to get clear shots of houses at the top of mountains while standing at the bottom. Pictures are clear, colors are nice, and the automatice setting is all I used. I should have used the night setting on a couple of shots, but for the most part it was not neccessary. I recommend this camera!
