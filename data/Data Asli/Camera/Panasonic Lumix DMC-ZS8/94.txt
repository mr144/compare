UPDATE: below is what I said.  I got my new Lumix and it is a complete lemon.  had it less than a year, never even dropped it, it takes crappy photos, there's a spot on the pictures who knows where that came from, I tried to contact panasonic but to no avail.  You might get a good one or a crappy one, beware.What I said before:I am an outdoor professional.  I carried this thing on my belt in a case riding an ATV all summer long.  I dropped it, bumped it, completely abused it.  Even fell into a creek and submerged it, took out the battery and dried it, and it still worked afterword.  Took me about a year to kill it--I imagine the corrosion from the creek finally got to be too much for it.  I am incredibly hard on stuff and a huge cheapskate.  It takes a lot to impress me, and I can not say enough good things about this camera.P.S.  it takes amazing photos, and the zoom is unbelievable for this size camera.  I bought one for my mom, and when mine died I bought another for myself.  You should absolutely buy this camera.
