My husband and I recently purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8 camera and are totally satisfied with our purchase. It is the best small camera we have ever owned. The options for taking pictures are easily understood; it was so easy to catch my 3 year old grandson speeding down the driveway on his tricycle using the sports adjustment: absolutely no blurring! The 16x zoom is very satisfying when you want to catch something at some distance away. The burst adjustment allowed me to photo a rabbit in the yard who might move any second by taking 4 photos in quick succession: we caught him perfectly! I am looking forward to trying out some of the other options!
