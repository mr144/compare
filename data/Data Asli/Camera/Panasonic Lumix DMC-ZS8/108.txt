I had a Kodak easy share for years and loved it- but I could not get photos of my kids on stage at there performances without the being dark or blurry. With this camera I can get those shots! I also love the zoom- very crisp and clear even on the high zoom setting (I have not used the digital zoom- but have not needed it due to the high optical zoom).my only complaint is when taking close ups - a few inches away- there is often a dark shadow in one coroner of the photo unless taken in a LOT of light.
