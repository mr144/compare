the camera is OK for the price, and the long zoom is amazing, but:1. low light performance just so-so, due to a 1/2.33 CCD, which is too small;2. it would have been better if it had an option of smaller size of pic., e.g., 1600x1200, or 1280x960;3. the video is with a .mov extension and it is a quicktime format, this make me crazy since I have been trying weeks for a player for it. And I do not want to install a useless player (like the apple quicktime) specifically for video from this camera. What is more, many players which claim to be able to run quicktime failed to do it, and I do not know it is because of the camera, or those playersThe main reason I rated it with one star is the shipping experience: last time I used amazon to shop, the on-line system misled me to put the wrong address----I got it right at first but amazon suggested me to omit my apartment #, and this made the UPS not able to deliver it. And when I updated my address with UPS, they delivered it one day later than they promise and I need to wait in my apt for extra days (it should arrive on Thr. stated by amazon, but I got it 6 PM on the following TUE.)
