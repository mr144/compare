Great little pocket camera. I have a 5 year old lx2 and used the same sd card and the pictures taken with the dmc-zs8 are virtually identical. The real difference is that the display monitor of the zs8 is oustandingly superior. There in nothig wrong with the lx2 but the zx8 is easyer and much simpler to use. But I miss the RAW feature of the lx2. YOU REALLY DO GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
