I was going to buy a cheaper camera and save $100.00, but on a friends recommendation I went ahead and got this for a recent trip to Central America. Excellent picture quality, great setting selections and very easy to use. Fast activation from turn on to shutter release. Can be used with one hand to turn on and reach shutter button. Very nice bright viewfinder. The larger than most Leica lens is extremely sharp throughout the zoom range. Image stabilization allowed me to get the monkey in the tree, full frame and no motion blur. Plus it is small enough to carry in a pant pocket.I did recommend it to any level user, from a point and shooter through a pro who wants full control of exposure settings
