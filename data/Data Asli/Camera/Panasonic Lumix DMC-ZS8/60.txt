I like to go on birding trips and foraging for wild mushrooms, and am approaching 72. These days I find my aging joints need to carry less, so bought this sleek little camera for portability, expecting some reduction in quality.  What a revelation! The pictures are so sharp and clear, it is so light to carry, and most of all, the onscreen instructions are so easy to understand; so much better than having to look everything up. It also is very good at taking shots with indoor lighting.This has largely replaced my big Canon, maybe completely, although on sunny days I do miss the viewfinder.
