Coupled with the [ASIN:B004TLK8GM Panasonic DMW-MCTZ20 Underwater Marine Case for Lumix DMC TZ20 Digital Camera]], the ZS8 is great dive camera for less than $500 complete. That's crazy.I have taken several thousand exposures with this camera underwater. The results are stunning. (See the images.) The built-in flash is ready to be used to trigger an external strobe. You get through-the-lens exposure control with no fuss.When the dive is over, the ZS8 comes out of the u/w housing to become a great pocket camera again. So much versatility, portability, and image quality for so little expense.
