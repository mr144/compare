Not had time to test it much yet, but it is okay so far and responds well - the main reason why I am upgrading from my Olympus which responds slowly. Also, the battery life seems long enough.The only problem I have with it is that the letters on the dial on top are not intuitive unlike my Olympus which used symbols all through. You'll really need to read the manual...
