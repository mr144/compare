I am not a pro.  Just an amateur who likes to take candid pictures. I have owned this Lumix DMC ZS8 camera for bout 10 months now.  I have taken hundreds of pictures(graduations, cruise, soccer games, indoors and outdoors, various lighting) and am extremely satisfied with this 'point and shoot' camera.  Great zoom.  Great HD video. Great close-up pictures. Sharp pictures.  Have also taken pictures of my son's soccer games with great results(although the shutter burst was not as fast as my Nikon d5000).  I was contemplating on buying an expensive 18-300 lens for my DSLR but now use the Lumix SZ8 to take zoom pictures, and have kept my standard 18-55 on my Nikon D5000 for closer pictures.Highly recommended.
