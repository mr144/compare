Bought this camera to replace a broken one, I just wanted a camera that I will not have problems with, this one got good reviews.  I spent more than I planned but it was worth it.  It is better than any camera I have ever had, and very easy to use and the pictures turn out so well, it looks like I really know how to take photos.  You can not beat that!
