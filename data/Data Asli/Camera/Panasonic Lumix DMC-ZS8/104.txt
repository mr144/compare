i was eager to try panasonic and bought this when i had to send my canon sx-130 for repair.  wow, i was impressed right off the bat.  the lens is incredibly sharp, focus is fast, and the controls all seem to be in the right place.  it has its limitations like all point and shoots, (particularly low light), but for a camera that will fit in my pocket i can live with that.  it feels right in my hand.....sturdy.  i now have my canon back, but use the lumix more often because of the way it feels.  they both take good pictures, and each can outdo the other at some things.
