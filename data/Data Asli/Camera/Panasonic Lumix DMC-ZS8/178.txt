The aluminum housing at the end of the lens is extremely fragile, thinner than an aluminum soda can.  I slightly dented it doing macro photography.  The camera continued to work fine, until three weeks later it refused to start up, even with fresh batteries. At this point, it was less than two moths old.  I returned the camera under the warranty.  Panasonic would not honor the warranty, saying the dent indicated abuse.  They offered me a refurbished unit with a 90 day warranty for a $192.50.  I refused.  I do not think the camera is robust or worth the $s compared to competitors.  I will put the $192.50 toward a Nikon or Olympus or Canon camera instead.Again, the Panasonic warranty program seems designed to refuse honest warranty repairs.
