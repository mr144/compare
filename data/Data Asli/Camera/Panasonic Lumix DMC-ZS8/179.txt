I bought a Fuji a few weeks ago, and I thought will be betta than the Lumix, weel I was wrong. I sold it and bought this ZS8, just impressive!25/07/2011:Lens get dust inside, as all my previuos Lumix. I have to think that Panasonic have poor quality controls or poor seals process. Frustation! Check your very carefuly!!Saludos, Allan.
