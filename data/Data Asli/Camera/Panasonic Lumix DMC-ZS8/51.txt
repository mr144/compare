So first, I bought this somewhere other than Amazon but I can not imagine why.  Anyway, the camera has a great zoom, and it takes decent pictures under most conditions.  I did even rate the video as good.  So why the rating and title? Because it must be the most fragile camera I have ever owned/  I would not have realized it by holding it, but I went on a trip recently and placed it in my carry on, and a day or so after landing I realize the display is broken.  The camera was out of warranty so I ordered a replacement screen to be shipped to my home.  A week later I traveled back, again with it in my carryon and when I take it out the shutter button comes off.  Now, I have done similar trips dozens of times with other cameras and never had an issue.  I definitely did not mistreat my carryon, so I will not be buying any more of these.  I'll also note that the camera is larger than most (but the 2012 models are thinner though also more expensive), and it did not take very good low light pictures.  Again, I did steer clear altogether (though I did buy a Panasonic TV or razor in a heartbeat).
