I bought the ZS8 basically for the 16x zoom in a pocket camera. Although the low light shots were not as good as I would have liked I was mainly pleased with the camera. After having it for a little less than six months it had dust specks inside the camera that were visible in the photos. The camera is usually in its case when not in use and it has never been used in any kind of dusty environment. Even though it supposedly has a 1 year warranty Panasonic said I needed to send it to their repair facility in Texas and pay for the repairs. I am not going to spend money to fix a problem that should be covered by warranty and that seems to be a recurrent problem according to many posts I have now read about internal dust issues with the ZS8.
