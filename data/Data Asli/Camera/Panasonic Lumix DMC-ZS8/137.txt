I used a Panasonic DMC ZR-1 for two years at work, pasted it on to my assistant, and purchased this DMC AS-10 two months ago for my work.  It is only slightly heavier and a bit thicker than the 8X zoom ZR-1.  It performs wonderfully.  I was able to photograph a Red Tailed Hawk with its prey without disturbing the bird and the resulting photos are outstanding. Oh yes, I did purchase it for work but it is convenient to use and I carry it everywhere.  Pre-set 'scenes' make unusual lighting situations automatic to the extreme and I can manually adjust the exposure with complete control when I want to.  The rapid fire feature allows me to take five exposures rapidly and I can choose the best one afterwards.  Easy on battery life and the controls come to hand without fumbling about.  I highly recommend this camera.
