This replaced our old Lumix, and we would buy another.  This one does feel a bit lighter (thinner shelled) than one from ~ 2007, but has thankfully survived a few clumsy falls.Battery life is excellent and loads of pictures and videos will fit on 8GB card.Capable of good pictures with a steady hand and proper lighting.  Pretty quick for point and shoot, but flash can delay shots, causing you to miss smiles or other action.  Incredible zoom and more modes than we use.  Obviously not capable of instant or rapid shots like an SLR.Best feature is excellent sound and video recording.  Great capacity for clear high definition videos &#60; 10 minutes long, which we can then slice and dice on computer.  We have toddlers and do not need a separate video camera to capture the times.  Also recorded some family music for grandparents and sound quality surpasses computer sound recorder.
