I have a photo count of less than 1000 on this camera. I have another Panasonic camera, DMC-F3. Its sensor and autofocus deteriorated after reaching a photo count of ~4000. Panasonic customer service is impossible. It refused to repair even though the camera is 6 month old.I hope this model will last longer than 4000.
