This camera sucks! I have it for 8 months and I am forced to open it each month to clean the sensor (I learned that from a youtube video). Unfortunately I can not clean the huge amount of dust accumulated inside the lenses (not on the sensor). Panasonic need to recall all these cameras and replace them with new ones for the people who spend over 200 dollars for a camera worst than a $50 one. In few months my camera will be impossible to use because of the dust accumulated between lenses. Do NOT buy this camera!
