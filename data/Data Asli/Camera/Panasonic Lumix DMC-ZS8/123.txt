I was on a trip with friends in June and saw first hand the capability of this camera.  The zoom enables many photo ops that other 'hand-held' cameras did not offer to me before.  I was able to get pics in situations that I would not have considered getting with my other cameras.The camera is light weight and fits in the shirt pocket easily, but it feels substantial, not cheap.  Good directions are provided.  I needed them to help locate how to use the MANY features that are available.  (For the first time, I successfully took pictures of last 4th of July fireworks!)  I am now a believer in Panasonic products after being a Canon user for years.
