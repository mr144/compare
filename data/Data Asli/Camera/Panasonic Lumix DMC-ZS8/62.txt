I used the DMC ZS8 for 6 months of tough back country photography. Great camera/features untill a spot showed up inside on the lens. I'll probably buy another one since it will be close to $200 to fix this one. REVISITED 1 year later- Shortly after my original review I found a youtube video showing how simple it is to clean this camera. I cleaned the lens, and have used the lumix ever since under tough conditions (ice to dust) and still love it. It is an awsome camera and, due to the size, I have it with me all of the time while my larger cameras gather dust.
