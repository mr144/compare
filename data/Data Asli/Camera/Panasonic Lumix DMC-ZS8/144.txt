While I have a little experience with photography, I am far from a good amateur. We own two digital cameras. We had been on two trips this year and the pictures taken on both were frustratingly affected by our camera's abilities (composure is very different from exposure and focus when those are supposed to be automatic). I was looking for a good camera that would take clear pictures (no matter what light), speedy on start-up and picture to picture, allow me a little flexibility, good battery life, but be easy for my wife (full auto mode).  I decided on this ZS8 (I consider a moderately priced camera).A week after getting it (very quickly with free shipping), we went to Niagara Falls. What a great decision! The camera starts up very quickly, there is very little lag between shots, and 99.9% of the pictures had focus that was sharp as a tack. The very few times the focus was poor, it was because of the situation and my impatience with allowing the second or two for the camera to focus. The stabilization system is spectacular! I was taking pictures of fireworks through a hotel window; the focus was sharp and the exposure was perfect. In the butterfly conservatory (a really fantastic place), my nature photographs - auto macro mode and exposure - were perfect. I bought an extra battery with this camera and was sure to have it charged and ready to go if necessary (I did not have to press it into service until the end of the trip - 300 pictures, some with flash).Nice size that fits my ham-hands without being large or impossible to carry/store. I had considered a similarly priced Canon and Sony and tried them in a local Best Buy with surprising results: Both of these cameras felt tiny in my hands. Both cameras had issues with taking focused pictures in less than perfect lighting (zoom to max on close object). The Panasonic was also available for my comparison and was really comfortable to use.Great camera. This is going to be a camera we will keep for years.
