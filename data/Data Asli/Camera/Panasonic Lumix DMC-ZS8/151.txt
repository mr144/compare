I bought this after returning my Nikon s9100 due to it freezing a number of times.  I chose this over the zs10 because of price (amazon's price was 50$ cheaper than Best Buy) and because I did not care about GPS or the video button on top of the camera as I do not use cameras for video.  This camera is simple to use. I was really surprised at the clarity and detail in the pictures that I have taken.  I thought they turned out better than the ones I took with the Nikon.  The zoom is more than enough.  I wish that the Lumix had more effects, like on the Nikon, but I'll take the picture quality over effects any day.  If you are looking for a quality P&S then definitely check this one out.
