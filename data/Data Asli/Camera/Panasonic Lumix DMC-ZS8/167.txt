I bought this for a trip to Rome. It took great pictures with a good zoom range and decent wide angle for scenes in the city. Worked well with night shots on the correct setting. The various settings were easy to understand after a few minutes since they are logically done The video feature seems to work well but I have not done much with that yet. The pictures that we printed were sharp and the small size makes it easy to carry. I still prefer a separate viewfinder for bright light but seems to be rare on any cameras in this price range. We are very satisfied with the camera.
