This is a nice camera from the standpoint that it takes good pictures and is easy to use. However there are lots of cameras out there that are just as good and this one is quite stupidly designed. After 7 months of use dust got on the inside of the lens. The design of the zoom lens is such that it is quite open and the dust gets inside when its just laying in your pocket. The result is smudges and specs on the pictures you take. The problem is that you cannot clean it out without removing and taking apart the lens assembly. That is not a straightforward process if you do not have an electrical engineering degree. Your options are to send it to get cleaned every few months, do it yourself (and risk breaking the thing), or to buy another camera that does not have these problems. My recommendation is the latter.
