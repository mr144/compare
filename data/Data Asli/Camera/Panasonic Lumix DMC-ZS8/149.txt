We loved this camera for the short 4 month lifespan it had.  One day it just froze up with the zoom out and open.  We tried everything to get it to work again.  Thankfully it was under warranty...or so we thought.  After having it professionally wrapped and shipped, Panasonic let us know they received the camera.  Over 2 weeks after they received it, they called us to say we owe them $175 to repair the camera.  They said the camera is  didamaged' and therefore not under warranty. This was after they sat on the camera for 2 weeks.They have yet to define what the  didamage' is, but they are adament that there was no way one of their workers dropped/damaged the camera in the 2+ weeks they had the camera in their possession.  We know the camera had no damage when we sent it in.  Oh, well I guess we need to buy a new camera and it will not be Panasonic because we are not paying it.So in a nutshell, it does a great job.  But if you have problems with your camera, be ready to have to pay for a repair.  Some warranty.  BUYER BEWARE!
