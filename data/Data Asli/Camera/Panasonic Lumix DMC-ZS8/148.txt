I love this camera. It takes great pictures and movies,which of course was my main objective. What I do not like is the instructions. The owners manual is very difficult to read and not user friendly. This camera has a great many features that would make custom picture taking possible but I am not a camera expert and have no idea how to use the many features. I really wish it came with a video tutorial. I do not even know where I could go to find better instructions. So five stars for the camera, no stars for the owners manual.
