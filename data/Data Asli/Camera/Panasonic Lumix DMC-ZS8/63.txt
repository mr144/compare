Unfortunately the ZS8 I ordered for my vacation arrived broken, and when contacting Panasonic the only thing I could do was send it back for repair, too late for use on vacation. After only 2 or 3 practice shots, the lens stuck in the open position and I could do nothing else, including turn it off.While damage during shipping can happen, the fix from Panasonic was unacceptable.
