Just came back from out west using our Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8 camera for the first time.  The zoom quality was excellent & the camera was very easy to use.  We got great pictures.  The only negative thing I have to say is the problem with the sun glare on the screen.  It was impossible to see what you were filming.  Have ordered glare shields but have not received yet.  Hope this solves the problem.  Other than that I have no complaints.
