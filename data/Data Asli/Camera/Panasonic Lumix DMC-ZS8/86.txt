I have taken this camera on a few trips, and overall I am impressed.  I liked the zoom, I LOVE the look, and the feel is great too.  I have always had a Canon until I got that awful lens error and had to buy this one, and after all is said and done, I think I would still buy canon again.  While the specs are all better on the lumix, I did not find the manual controls to be easy, and the white balance kept throwing me off.  The images were crisp enough though, and I like the large lcd screen.  I bought this camera for a great price, and it is worth the value when you catch it on sale.
