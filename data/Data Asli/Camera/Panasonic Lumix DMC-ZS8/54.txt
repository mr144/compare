I have had this camera since May 2011 and use it almost everyday.  I love to take pictures and own a DSLR for serious photos, but carry this one with me in a case to capture everyday photos.  It has taken great photos and I have generally been happy with it.  The option to use the manual controls are a nice feature on a point and shoot if in extreme situations where auto does not produce the photo you want. This camera is better than canon, kodak, pentax, fujifilm, GE or coolpix. Given the amount of use this has had in about a year and a half, this camera has held up really well but I wanted to reiterate other's reviews about the dust under the lense.  I started having this problem about 5 months ago and it seems like from these other reviews, it is a camera defect and it will happen eventually to everyone who uses this camera unless retiring it after a few months.  That being said, the dust only seems to show on my pictures sometimes when I zoom.  It shows on the screen before I take a picture so I will usually just zoom it in or out 1 or 2x until it goes away.  It is a little bit of a nuisance but given the large zoom this camera has it has not been a major issue.  Additionally, the lens cover does not open all the way, but I found pushing it gentle with the pinky does the trick and does not affect camera performance.
