Good camera--produced hundreds of excellent pictures on our trip to SE Asia.BUT-and it is a big one because we have two new grand-babies at home--portraits taken indoors with the flash turned off are never sharp. NEVER. And I am not talking about candle-lit situations; I mean in a an interior in daytime with nice light coming in through windows. And the closer you zoom, the softer the picture. Thus the value of the great 16x zoom is cancelled out. I'll still take it on trips, but after seeing the poor results in my baby pictures, I re-ordered the smaller, less versatile, cheaper Nikon Coolpix I did given to my daughter when I got the Lumix. Her pictures of the same baby are much crisper and clearer.
