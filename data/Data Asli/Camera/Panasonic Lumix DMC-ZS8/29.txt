This camera has been amazing.  The wide angle is exceptional.  People who are professional photographers have even been grudgingly impressed with the wide angle capability of this camera.  The video is nice quality as well.  I have used this camera for two years, and love it.  Lots of manual settings to experiment with, and good automatic settings as well.  The zoom is very nice as well, and the quick zoom button is a cool feature.  Decent performance in low light.  Highly recommend for a point and shoot, or for someone who wants to use more manual settings.  Great camera!
