I wanted a camera that would let me take great photos but did not require much knowledge about complicated cameras, I needed one that was also light to carry because of the amount of traveling that I do.  I have had good cameras before that have had so many functions that because of simplicity, I stuck to only using the basics of them.  (This camera fits all of the bills and at a very reasonable price with this seller who offers a good deal!)  Funny thing was, a month ago while on vacation touring Romania and the Baltics, not only a couple, but many people on my tour had Lumix cameras, this very model and some older models.  I really liked it and will purchase another one in the future.  If you are on the fence, give it a try.  I think the photos will prove your decision to be a very positive one.
