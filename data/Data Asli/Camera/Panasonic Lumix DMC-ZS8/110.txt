I ordered this camera bc of the great zoom and high mp, but in the end it was just too big and bulky and the picture quality was not that great.  When comparing it is pictures with some pics taken with my friend's Canon 300HS, the canon's quality were better by far.  Plus it is much more compact.  Perhaps I just could not figure out how to get the best shots with the panasonic but even having it in the auto mode did not produce great pics.  They seemed a little grainy and the the color was flat.
