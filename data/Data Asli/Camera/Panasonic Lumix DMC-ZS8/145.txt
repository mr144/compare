I just purchased this camera, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8, and after shooting just a few pictures, I think that it is a winner.  The only problem I have found to date has to do with the LCD screen. It is too reflective.  At the beach on a sunny day, facing toward the sun, all I could see was my own refelection in the LCD. Shading the screen with my hand did not help.  The camera needs a non-refective add on screen cover or some type of hood.  If anyone has any suggestions, I would like to hear about them.
