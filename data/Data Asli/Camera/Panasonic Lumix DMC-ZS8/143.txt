I did a lot of research for a point and shoot camera with a powerful optical zoom. I looked at the Sony, Nikon and Fuji as well as this Panasonic. I read reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and other sites. I was most impressed with what others said about the Panasonic ZS8 over all the others. This is just a great camera and I can not say enough good things about it. I am very happy with my purchase and I know you will be happy with your purchase of the Panasonic Lumix DMX-ZS8 over any other point and shoot camera.
