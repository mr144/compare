I have chosen this camera, because I already had a Panasonic DMC-ZR1, which made very good pictures, but got some dust/dirt into the lens. The lens shutter of the new ZS8 stopped opening/closing properly just after 2 weeks. Returned it to the seller and got reimbursed promptly. I will give an another try with the Panasonic ZS19. The big plus is, all this models have the same battery and loading socket.
