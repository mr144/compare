This is my first digital camera so a lot of this might be old to you, but I am very impressed by all the features.  For example, baby mode?  This camera can recognise a baby and allow text input of birth date so that subsequent photos automatically disply the new ages (1 week, 1 month, 6 months, etc.).  Incredible.  In fact, anyone can be identified by a facial recognition system after they are named once on the camera.  Well, I have not tried that but it seems unbelievable.  Image stablization is optional.  Too many features to name here.The zoom factor is amazing too.  I zoomed in on a soup can from 20ft and filled the image with the name on the label!  I do not know, but that just seems really good to me.  The video recording works good.  Audio records in mono only.  You need to buy a memory card to record videos but not all cards are compatable.Also, it feels solid and heavier than it looks.  LCD screen is clear but a little hard to see in sunlight.PROS:  Size, eaze of use, multiple features, amazing scene recognition, wide exposure control options, image quality, includes basic software that does most everything you needCONS:  Fewer special effects than I expected (but of course those can be added in post-production), rechargable battery, AC adapter not included but should have been for the price (availble for purchase, not needed as long as you have a charged battery)
