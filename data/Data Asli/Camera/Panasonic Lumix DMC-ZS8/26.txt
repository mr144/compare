I bought this for a friend of my wife who does not know the first thing about photography nor cameras. So of course I got to use it before her so I could acquaint her with it. I like it, but then again, I like all the Lumix-es (Lumixi) that i have used. I personally have a waterproof DMC-TS3. It's the reason I recommended this one for her.It's a really good balance of user friendly and versatile. Not to intimidating for someone uninitiated.So far, quality is wonderful. The price is right and she's very blown away. So I am happy.I am not a professional but I know enough to know quality from crap.If you really want a good review of this or ANY camera, I really suggest going to dpreview.com. They are REALLY thorough and far more reliable than any review you can get here. I always check out a camera there before I consider buying it.
