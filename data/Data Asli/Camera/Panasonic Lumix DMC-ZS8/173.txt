I use this for work as a property inspector. The optical zoom allows me to get great shots from a distance without necessarily having to get right up on the subject. I have it set up as needed and have not used many of the other features. I am just happy to be able to get a 16x optical zoom at such a great price. This was a replacement for a Panasonic DMC-TZ1 that took over 10,000 pictures before starting to wear out mechanically. Took a real beating out in the field. I hope this one lasts as long.
