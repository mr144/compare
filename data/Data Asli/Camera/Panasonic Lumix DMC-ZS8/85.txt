The ZS10 was the better of the two --- or supposed to be.  Now it is the ZS15 and ZS20.  I bought a ZS15 for $179 on amazon.  Better sensor.  But still a poor low light camera.  If you buy a compact superzoom, but the ZS15.  Better yet, skip it and buy the FZ150 if you can swing it.  A MUCH better camera.  If you want to get something cheaper get the Canon SX40 for somewhat less and a 35x zoom (pure optical).  Superzoom compacts are not yet good enough.  So, if you have to, wait.
