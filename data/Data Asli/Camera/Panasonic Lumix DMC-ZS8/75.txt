I bought this as my first 'serious' camera in order to take digital photography classes in school.  I have to say it stood up to every challenge that's been thrown at it for that class, and more.  With full manual controls it performed just as well as the better 'bridge' cameras that the school had.  Detail and clarity is fantastic, and it has a great range of zoom.  The operation was easy to learn, or you can throw it on auto and get awesome shots without having to think about it.  Particularly impressive was it is video capabilities and the smooth zoom featured within. The only thing I missed about it was the ability to manually focus, otherwise I truly LOVE this camera.  I am moving up into the dslr range now, but refuse to sell off or get rid of this one, as it is a nice, small but powerful member of my equipment roster.  I would recommend it to anyone from a beginner to a semi pro as a great camera choice.
