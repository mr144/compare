Ca not say enough on this one. Sure - if money is no object, you can get better, but anything past this, you are past the point of diminishing returns.The optics are great - pictures are clear, sharp, undistorted, and there is great versatility for lighting. The zoom lens is long - and gives clear shots. The autofocus does a great job of adjusting for a good diversity of scenes - especially very high and low light - and is super fast (except when you have several faces against a background of varying depth). The flash is mediocre - not awful - but definitely uneven.The interface is stock panasonic - clear, direct, intuitive. Buttons are where you expect, do what you expect. The rechargeable battery is good for between 250-400 images, depending on your use.The screen is good - clear - but in the brightest light - it washes out - especially with sunglasses.The macro is great. I compared with similar Canons and Nikons - I am not sure anything has the combination of strengths this does. Leica lense - great interface - 16x zoom - and terrific build quality. It's the best camera I have had.
