We replaced an earlier version of the Lumix, which was a wonderful camera but the zoom was acting up and repairing it would have cost more than half of the cost of this better camera.  Everything about this camera is great.  The best positive I will leave you with is to describe the picture quality.  We have three pictures from a Europe trip which we had made into 24 x 36 prints on canvas.  Everyone that sees them cannot stop staring.  They look like beautiful paintings and on one we made of a canal in Bruge, you can look into a window of a home and appreciate the 5 red apples on a kitchen counter.  Terrific!
