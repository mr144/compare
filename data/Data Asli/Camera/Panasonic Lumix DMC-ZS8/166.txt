Before purchasing this camera I shopped around quite a bit, comparing reviews and critiques and such, and even after reading about how good this line of cameras (and this one in particular) is, I was still amazed at how great it is.On a trip to Kentucky this summer I used this camera to take a crystal clear picture from about 600 yards away with the digital zoom all the way in. SLR users might disagree on this point, but I honestly can not tell the difference between the clarity of this shot and ones taken without using any zoom at all. Further, another shot I took was of a motorcycle going down the road at around 45mph, and with just the intelligent auto it came out only a little blurry. I have since been impressed by the sports setting (which allows multiple shots to be taken in quick succession and with a shorter shutter speed, so you can get those split second shots) so I can only imagine what that bike would have looked like with the sports setting.The software that comes with the camera is also fairly impressive. It's nothing compared to Photoshop, for example, but for an application that is included with the camera it does very well. I have used it several times to clean up shots or enhance particular colors in a shot. Another point of note is that the software comes with its own panorama stitching option and does a marvelous job with it. There's also a panorama assist setting on the camera itself, which really helps when trying to make a panorama shot.Granted, this is the first digital camera I have owned, and granted that I am very much an amateur at this, but this is one of the best cameras I have ever seen and have been complimented several times by people more experienced in photography.
