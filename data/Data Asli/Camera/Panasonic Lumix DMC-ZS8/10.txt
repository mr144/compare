The DMC-ZS8 is, or should I say 'was', a great camera.  Unfortunately, this is the second Panasonic Lumix camera that we purchased that has failed on us.I forget the model number of the first one, but it took wonderful photos for about 3 years, then the lens would not open completely.  We liked the camera so much that we decided to spend $150 to have it repaired.  The  arepaired' camera worked for about a year, maybe less, then failed again.  Same problem - lens would not open completely.  Waste of $150.I searched for a replacement camera but I could not find anything at a reasonable price that measured up to the combination of Panasonic and Leica.  So I bought the DMC-ZS8.  It, too, WAS a great camera.  But, it only lasted 15 months.  Now it just displays 'System error (Focus)' on the screen.  It does not do anything.Panasonic customer service offered NO HELP because the 1 year warranty had expired.  They want $180 to repair it!! (It only cost $150 new!!)Let me just emphasize here that we do not abuse cameras or anything else that we own.  We handle them very carefully.I thought I would not be able to beat Panasonic electronics combined with a Leica lens. I guess I was wrong. 'Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me'.  I will never buy another Panasonic camera, and will be unlikely to buy anything else from Panasonic again.  If you are considering this camera, I would strongly urge you to look to another brand.  I am heading straight for Canon or Nikon.
