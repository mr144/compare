I bought this camera as a backup to my DSLR and for those instances when I just want to travel light.  So far, it has not disappointed.First for the cons:  Just like most (if not all) point and shoots, indoor pics and flash pics suffer a little.  The flash leaves a hard, metallic tone on the images and redeye is common.  The camera has a reduction mode, but I never use it, I find the  didouble flash' confuses posing subjects and results in movement and akward facial expressions.  I also do not like that the proprietary battery has to be removed from the camera for charging.  So far, battery life is excellent, but I have not kept track of how many pictures/flashes/image reviews I can do between plug ins. Lastly, the camera is a bit thicker than I would have hoped for.  Some of the comparable products on the market are considerably thinner.As for the pros:  the camera takes great, high resolution outdoor shots.  I have had good luck with automatic mode as well as Av, Sv and the various scene modes it offers.  Color balance is very accurate with WB set to automatic, although images captured with chosen WB settings  neon, indoor) came out well also.  I also like that the advanced user can dial up or dial down exposure by fractions of stops, and I believe the camera can autobracket as well, although I have not tried it yet. Lastly, the menus and the user interface is very intuitive and easy to understand. If you have been around digital cameras for any length of time, you should be able to figure this one out without reading the users' manual.  Digital zoom and image stabilization, both big selling points for this camera do not figure much into my shooting style, so I can not provide intelligent commentary on either.Although I much prefer my big, bulky DSLR to ANY point and shoot pocket camera, I know that on days I bring this one along, at least I'll get clean, crisp, high quality pictures of my unforgettable moments.
