This is my third Panasonic Lumix camera... I LOVE them. However I have a major issue with it.  After about a year / year and half of regular usage, random black marks show up when using the video feature.  It has happened with all three of my cameras so I just assumed I was misusing it.  However, with my latest purchase, I went out of my way to care for it and it has never been dropped.  So when the black marks showed up, I totally lost faith in my beloved camera.  While I would recommend this to a friend (and have, 5 of my friends have purchased this same model) I am beginning to think I erred in my judgement.
