I always carry a small camera in my purse for those times when an unexpected opportunity happens.  I bought this one as a replacement for an earlier panasonic, but I have also had a Nikon Coolpix and a Canon elph.This camera is totally amazing.  The clarity of the images, the speed, the telephoto and close-up functions are beyond reproach.  I would very highly recommend this camera to anyone wanting a small, convenient travel camera.  The battery is long lived and not expensive, so I always have a second at the ready.  I find myself using this camera even more often than my DSLR.
