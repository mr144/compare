My Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8 comes through with flying colors on clarity, color, and a vast variety of shooting modes. Not too sure about the shutter and aperture settings as yet. I tried photographing at very slow shutter speeds on the A setting and the pics came out way overexposed. The exposure should be automatically set at that setting. Also, you can only upload the photos to the computer via the camera itself, which is slow. Trying it with my fast memory reader device did not work at all. Other than that, it is smooth sailing, and I love that 16:9 aspect ratio option.
