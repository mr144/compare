As I was preparing for a trip to Europe I needed a good camera, one that would take sharp, colorful pictures and was small enough to slip into my pocket. I know the bigger cameras take great pictures but did not want to be burdened with hauling one around.  The reviews for the Lumix camera portrayed it to be just what I was looking for. I was not disappointed.  These are the features I really like about it: It turns on and is ready to take a photo incredibly fast. Sometimes you just can not wait around for your camera to power up. The 16X zoom is what initially got me interested in this camera. It quickly zooms out to cover those distant shots that you want to enlarge.  Because of the wide angle lens you do not have to back way up to get an entire building or scene in the photo. I really like the 'scene' mode feature that allows for different light settings. There were several places in Europe where the lighting was dim but I did not want a flash picture. It produced beautiful results.  There was even a middle of the night photo of the moon, stars and a few city lights that turned out wonderfully. I have received several compliments on my photos wondering what kind of camera took such great shots. There is also a picture 'burst' feature that takes several shots very quickly to capture just that 'right' moment. It worked very well when a German friend was demonstrating shooting his muzzleloader rifle. I wanted to have a photo of the moment the smoke and fire shot out the barrel.  With the 8 pictures I had taken in the space of about a second I was able to get just the perfect shot and delete the rest.  The Lumix DMC-ZS8 is an easy to use camera that takes great pictures. One added observation is I noticed a great number of people in Europe, from many countries, taking photos with the exact same model camera. I feel really good about my purchase.
