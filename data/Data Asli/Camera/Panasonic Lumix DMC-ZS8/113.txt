This is a replacement for another Panasonic camera with 10X zoom. I bought this one because it has even longer zoom. I found the swithc for shoot and view on the back of the camera is a bit not convenient. The old one you just turn the dial to select shoot or review. All in all, it is a great camera.By the way, my old one was soaked in water on the beach for a short time. It stopped working in a few days. However, just on the day this new one arrived, the old one went back to work again. This make me believe the quality of the Panasonic camera is great.
