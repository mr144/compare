I bought this camera as an upgrade to my Lumix ZS-3. I believed that with the upgrade; I would get better pictures using the zoom, and an improvement in low-light situations. I believe that the photo quality is the same as my old camera. The zoom in lower light situations, i.e. cloudy days causes the pictures to appear 'grainy' I end up deleting those. The zoom on my new ZS-8 is poor in quality, even in good lighting, and while stabilized; sitting on top of a table. I may have a defective camera, and I have no way of knowing. I bought it from one of Amazon's merchants, so as far as returns go; it may cause me more of a headache than anything else. I should have bought directly from Amazon. :(
