I bought this camera in July 2011 and it takes excellent pictures.  Recently it will not connect with the USB cable to my computer.  I called Panasonic and they told me it was probably a defective cable.  I bought a new one for approximately $10 including shipping.  The cable took a week to arrive and it still does not connect to my compouter.  I called customer service today and after tryimng for a half an hour it still does not work.  Since it is out of the one year warranty, I have to pay shipping and send it back with all the parts.  The repair costs $180 which is a joke since the new camera is only $230.  Fortunately my laptop has a card reader so I do not need to connect the camera to my computer.  Still, the camera is defective after very little use and the cost of repairs is crazy.  Let the Buyer Beware.
