I really like the camera! The zoom is awesome you get really close and the pictures still turn out great. The colors are nice too really colorful, I made pictures of fireworks and they look incredible! Video is also really nice not blurry at all!The only thing I wish is that the camera would be a little smaller, but in the end the pictures cound and it is not that its way too big just a little;)I have not installed the software wish was the main critic factor of many other rewies I have read, but I do not really need the software anyway you can do basic correctins of the pics with your own software and for me thats enough!Have fun with the camera! I certainly do!
