this is an absolutely terrific camera in all respects save one -- the battery, which is 'underpowered' ..if you do not want to charge it daily, it requires a battery with a minimum 1200 mAh, and I suspect even that may not be quite 'there' (I have just ordered one .. have to see .. bought the Wasabi Power Battery for Panasonic DMW-BCG10, which is advertised as compatible with  panasonics battery - DMW-BCG10PP - and i am hoping it actually is) .. also the 1200mAh are very hard to get, and not made by panasonic, so i am also hoping there will be no problems with firmware upgradesfor comparison, the 4 yr old fuji finepix F31fd i am replacing came with an 1800mAh battery, with pics/battery charge of around 580 (fuji's manual specs) .. we took over 5000 pics on a 5 week trip, and were never caught with a rundown batterythe LUMIX DMC-ZS8 comes with an 895mAh battery; their manual gives pics/battery charge of ~340 .. this is 1/2 the fuji's battery power, and only 60% of the pics/charge ..so panasonic would be strongly advised to upgrade the battery power substantially, right away .. 1800mAh would be ideal
