I purchased this camera to go to a Black Eyed Peas concert in Central Park in NYC.  It is fairly small and easy to handle, and it took GREAT pictures of the concert!  Given that it was relatively inexpensive (in the realm of decent point and shoot cameras with added features), I was very pleased with it.  I would say that we were approximately 50 feet or so from the stage (maybe farther).  It has a zoom feature which allowed me to focus-in, and the video recording feature produced very good quality, both for clips at the concert, and at an after party, as well.  I was very, very pleased with this camera, all in all.  I would recommend this camera to someone looking for easy-to-use camera with some nice added features that you do not get in a cheap model.
