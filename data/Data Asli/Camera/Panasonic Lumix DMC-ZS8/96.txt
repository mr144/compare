Takes great pictures for a while... Bought this camera in December, 2011. Took a few good pictures, then it fell victim to the dreaded 'System Error (Focus)' problem. Seems like plenty of other customers found the same problem:[...]  I paid around $150 to use a camera for about 6 months. If you buy one, good luck.UPDATE:(a few months later) Panasonic lived up to their warranty on this camera. My wife took the time to send it in for repair in June, 2012. I was not optimistic. However, in August, 2012 the camera was shipped to us following its repair, and is currently working. During the time it was in the hands of their repair facility we were called several times with updates. We did not have to call them. So, kudos to Panasonic on the customer service. Once again, taking great pictures. We'll see how long this continues. Hopefully, for a while.
