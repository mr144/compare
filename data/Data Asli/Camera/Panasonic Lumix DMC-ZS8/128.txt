As advertised and a great camera.  This is our 2nd Lumix and for the price point it is terrific.Highly recommend it for the average user that's looking for an excellent point and shoot with a few extra features, should you want to use them.  We find the stabilization feature one of the best on the market.  We choose Lumix again after reviewing everything out there in the product category.  Ca not go wrong!
