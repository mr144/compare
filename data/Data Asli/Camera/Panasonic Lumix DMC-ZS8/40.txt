After reading enough camera descriptions to blurr my vision, I decided on this Panasonic.  The size isperfect to fit in my purse, so I will always have a camera when all of &#34;those great shots&#34; that grandkids present.  The pictures are of good qualityalso.  What else could I say....great choice
