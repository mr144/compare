I loved this camera for a year and a half.  It took wonderful zoom pictures with vibration stabilization.  Then floaters appeared in all the pictures and I learned that repairs would cost almost as much as a replacement camera.  So I am back to the drawing board looking for a good, pocket-sized camera.
