I booked a week long safari to coincide with a business trip. I had a weight limit which included work computer and clothes in addition to the binoculars, camera and safari outfits. This camera was just right. The wide angle lens and 16x optical zoom produced beautiful photos. I did not even use a tripod or bean bag and the pictures were just as steady. I highly recommend this camera.
