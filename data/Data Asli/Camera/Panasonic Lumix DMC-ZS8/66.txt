This is a great little camera. I do not expect the same quality as an SLR, but I get some darn good photos with it. I got tired of lugging a camera case around. I always have it with me for the 'unexpected' photo op. In one compartment of my purse, I can carry the camera in the small carry case that I also bought on Amazon, an extra card, an extra battery, and the charger! If I just want to take the camera, I can hook it on my belt loop and do not even know it is there. For its size it has a great zoom and takes very good quality pictures.
