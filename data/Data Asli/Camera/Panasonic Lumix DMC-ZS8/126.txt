I purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8 a month ago in a rush since I was leaving to go on vacation in a day and a half. I had the camera sent to Wildwood NJ so I had a camera while away. Did not do the research but read the reviews and decided to order. This was my 3rd digital camera, I had a Sony purchased in 2007 (Sony Cybershot DSCW55 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver) and a Nikon purchased in 2010 (Nikon Coolpix S8000 14.2 MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3.0-Inch)both were damaged due to my children throwing them in the pool.My first impression was that it was not easy to use and pictures did not come out as clear as my other 2 cameras. I had to take several shots and adjust so the picture could come out good. After 2 days of using the camera, there was a error message (zoom error) that did not allow me to use the camera, I removed the battery closed it several times. Did not want to take a chance, when I returned from vacation I had to return it and will most likely  go with a NIKON, need to do the research before I decide on the model.  Amazon is amazing and so customer focused, more companies should be like this.
