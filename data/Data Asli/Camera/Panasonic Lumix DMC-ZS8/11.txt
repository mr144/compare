I am a fan of Panasonic and have 3 of their cameras. I used to have 4 but my daughter fell in love with this one and adopted it. Although it is a bit large for a shirt pocket, it has an incredible (wide angle/telescopic) range and produces nice clear pics. Lots of features but works just fine on the automatic setting.
