I have been using an olympus Optio waterproof camera for 10 years - all around reliability. I wanted to try another digital and got this Lumix. It has a better zoom and better image quality. It's not a professional camera, but I just use this for family and travel photos. I shared it with my nephew and he really enjoyed taking photos and piecing together great panorama shots of Yosemite and the Sierras. Good camera!
