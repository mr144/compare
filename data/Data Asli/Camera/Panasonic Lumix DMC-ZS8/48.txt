This small camera offers a lot for its size. The zoom is good, but would love to see one with 40x optical.My photo gallery of pics taken with this camera can be found here:http://synari.deviantart.com/Positive things:Lightweight & great zoom for size, just would love more magnification and quicker auto focus ability.Auto mode and image stabilizer are awesome.Outdoor photos in daylight have very good qualityVideo quality is decent outdoors/daylightBattery Life is excellent.I only have 4 complaints about this camera.1. The low light/night/indoor photos/video are HORRIBLY GRAINY and the image quality thus sucks.2. Dust and such get inside the lens easily and then cause spots on the photos.3. The price is too high for how it performs..i.e. action shots.4. No Burst setting for pics.Thought this camera is capable of taking action shots, most of them are not clear or of decent quality to use. Once in a while, you might get a great one, but its like once every 50 shots.While I love the size of this camera, I do not think I did buy another Panasonic unless they fix the noise in low light images and improve the action shot capabilities.Also, they need to improve the sharpness and speed of auto focus.
