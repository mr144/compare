I have purchased many products from Amazon but this is my first review. I have had this camera for about 3 months now and it has not disappointed me on any level. I am not a professional photographer but I do enjoy taking pictures. I was looking for a Point-and-Shoot camera with a good zoom and macro capability. I spent a lot of time looking for just the right one. But, in the end every camera review had some negative comment or two and that concerned me. I found the reviews for this camera to be all very positive. So, I took a chance. -- I am glad I did! This camera has so much capability built into it that it is amazing. And yet, it gives you the flexibility to be creative. Very nifty indeed. The picture quality is great - the zoom is great -- the macro capabilities are great! -I highly recommend this product -- Great Job Panasonic!!
