This camera is garbage and so is the customer service.  I bought the camera for Christmas and it was broken by April. The lens kept sticking and then we got an error message.  SO I had to send it back and they sent me a refurbished model.  Here it is three months later and the same thing happened.  Now they want me to send it in again!  I am so disappointed with the product.
