I have had several camaras dating back to the 60's.  My last camara was a Canon sureshot 3.5 pixels.  Actually quite modern except for the 3.5 pixels. To update I did a lot of research (based on reviews) and settled on the Lumix Z-s8.  It is super. Better than the Canon for videos and simplicity.  I have large hands and the Canon can be a little too little for me.  If I have one compaint it is this.  The viewing screen is so big and perfect that it can not be beat at night or in the shade. But in broad daylight, I can not see what I am aiming at. Probably a single lens reflex would be the only solution to that or maybe a little direct viewer next to the screen. Aside from that, it a perfect little camara.
