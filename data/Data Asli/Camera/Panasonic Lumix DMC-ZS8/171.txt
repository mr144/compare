Before reviewing this camera, a bit of perspective:I take good care of my cameras, and I am careful with them - for example I have a Panasonic DMC-TZ1 that after four years, and several thousand pictures, is still in daily use.So when picture quality finally began to degrade because of dust in the optical path and on the sensor (which I think is entirely reasonable for a camera that's received as much use as my TZ1) I decided to replace it with another Panasonic DMC.Big mistake.When I opened the box my first thought was 'Gee, these Panasonic's are sure getting more and more fragile looking - I understand the desire to shrink the size, and get the weight down, but still...', and considered sending it back on the spot, but found myself thinking 'Well, the camera is getting good reviews, I guess this is just the way they make them these days - it *can not* be as fragile as it looks'.So .. the first time I used this camera, after taking half-dozen pictures, I placed it briefly in a loose fitting shirt pocket...... and when I took it out a few seconds later, the LCD screen was inoperative with the kind of damage I have only been able to inflict once before before - by dropping a camera several feet onto a hard surface: the glass was not cracked, but the LCD matrix below the screen was damaged and no image would appear.This is just ABSURD, the camera was carefully placed in my pocket, there was was no more pressure against the LCD was present from sitting in the shirt pocket, the camera was placed in the pocket and removed by holding the frame, not the LCD - but there you have it: a major damage in not only normal use, but careful normal use.Fortunately, I had purchased an extended warranty that covers this kind of damage, because I am quite certain that if I return this to Panasonic, I will be told it had been damaged by  amishandling' - however I have not the least confidence that the replacement or repair wall last more than 10 minutes either.I am really going to have to rethink my preference for Panasonic cameras: the early TZs were tanks by comparison, but after my experience with this I can not imagine how a current generation model could survive a single day's normal usage by average consumer, and that seems to be a matter of deliberate design choice (for example my DMC-TZ1 has an actual lens cap, instead of the current generations flimsy mechanical cover).Perhaps Panasonic's target market is interested in a $300 disposable single use camera, but I am not - if I had wanted a single use disposable camera, I did have bought one at Walgreens for $13.And I can not imagine WHAT Panasonic had in mind producing a camera is apparently designed to fail if you contemplate any use that includes opening the packaging in which it is supplied - it is literally been years since I felt so disappointed by a relatively expensive consumer item from a company with which I previously had a good experience.I do not need or want a 'ruggedized' camera - just a camera that can be expected to last a few years in normal use.But based on my experience is clearly not the case for current generation Panasonic DMCs.
