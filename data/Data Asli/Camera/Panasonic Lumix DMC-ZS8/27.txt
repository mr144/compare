Oh Lordy, lord......I was soooooo upset when I could not find my camera.  I take lots of pictures every week.  So I bought the next model up that had come out since my original purchase.  As with the first camera, I am VERY pleased with this one.  It has many features that I have not used yet but I like knowing they are there is I need them.  I LOVE the large image viewer and the camera is very light weight and easy to hold for someone like me with small arthritic hands.
