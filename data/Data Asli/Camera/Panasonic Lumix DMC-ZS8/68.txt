Bought this camera in December 2011. Within a few months there were gray splotches on my photos. In an Internet search I found that others also had the same problem with this camera. I thought perhaps dust got into it so...in July 2012 I bought another camera, same one because when it took clear photos I loved the camera. Within 4 weeks it stopped working. I tried two different fully charged batteries that worked in the first camera (that is unusable because of the gray splotches) so it was not a battery issue. It just died, and I babied this camera. So now I am stuck with two of these cameras--one dead and one unusable. I would not buy this product again.
