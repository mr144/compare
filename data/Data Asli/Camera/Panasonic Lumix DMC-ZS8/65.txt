I bought this camera to replace a Kodak V610, which after several years and thousands of pics, finally bit the dust. (To my very deep sorrow, I must add, because I LOVED that camera!) I expected this to be a step up. Technically speaking it may be, but functionally it is a huge disappointment. I find the logic utterly confounding, so it takes me forever to find the correct setting for a given situation; and too often, by the time I figure that out, the opportunity is gone.But the worst offense is that the leaves on the lens cover malfunction constantly and unpredictably, opening fully as they should, or as just a hockey-stick-shaped slit, or not at all.  In total frustration, today I put a tiny dab of LockEase (colloidal graphite) on my finger, carefully rubbed it onto the leaves. I then activated the lens several times  - shaking the camera when necessary -to carry the graphite to the moving parts of the leaves. I can not be sure just yet that it is a fix, but the last dozen times I tried it, the cover opened fluidly and completely.My previous cameras (prior to the Kodak V610) were Olympus models, which I would have rated 4 and 5 stars. IF the lens cover problem is actually resolved (fingers crossed), the best I can say for this Lumix camera is that it is okay. My next camera will probably be a different brand (and I WILL buy through Amazon!).
