I am on my second DMC-Z58. On the first camera the lcd screen, for absolutely no reason at all, went totally bonkers with lines and spots, making it unusable. Because I had purchased the product replacement plan, I was promptly sent a new camera. Both cameras were not very good. They are terrible in low light, flash or not, the colors in the picture come out looking nothing like the actual colors. I know all point and shoots have this issue to some extent but I have used both the point and shoot Cannons and the Nikons Both in auto mode)and had nowhere near the problems I had on the Panasonic. In addition after less than 700 pictures,the lens cover on the DMC-Z58 continually sticks in a partially open position when the camera is turned on despite many, many efforts to clean and unstick it. Now the camera's zoom will not work, which, as many others have pointed out was the main reason for purchasing this camera in the first place. It starts to zoom, then gets stuck. So all in all, this camera has been a TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK. Thank goodness, I have a real camera (D90) so I do not have to rely on the Panasonic.
