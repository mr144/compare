Best POINT and SHOOT camera I have ever used. PERIOD.  I have been a Professional photographer since 1972. This camera takes a little getting used to. Once you do you will be in LOVE.  YOU will need Chapstick to keep your lips from chapping because of the excessive kissing of the camera out of PURE LOVE for it.
