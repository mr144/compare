What a great camera is all I can say. After having a little point and shoot camera for the last few years we decided it was time for me to upgrade. We have a nice big DSLR for occasions and my husband always got to use it and my pictures always looked, well, must worse than his (Facebook worthy but that's about it!). Now with this new camera my pictures come out almost as good as the DSLR and defiantly as good as a DSR and much easier to figure out! I can even zoom farther then his! The camera is fairly easy to use but has a lot of different options if you really want to get into it. It took a couple hours of playing around to get the majority of the stuff I would ever use. The quality of photos are just plain awesome for a point and shoot. We mostly use it for outdoor trips (hiking, national parks etc.), theme parks and around town. My only problem with it is I wish it was a little smaller. It is technically pocket sized but is just a little too big to fit comfortably in your pocket. But for all the amazing stuff this little camera can do, we just overlook that! It still fits into a small camera case which is how I carry it around. The best point and shoot camera you can buy and really does compare with a DSR and literally is 1/3 the size!
