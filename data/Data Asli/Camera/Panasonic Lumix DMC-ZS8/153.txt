I purchased this camera to use on travel when I did not want to lug around my SLR. So far I have been very happy with the results, especially the ease of use. The dials are intuitive and the menus state what each option will do. I actually bought the Canon SX 230 HS first and sent it back, even though I have loved all my Canons and the quality of their photos is excellent. It was just too slow and very difficult to use. I could not even get the exposure compensation to work. With this camera, I was able to use all the features right away. I also like how quickly it takes the picture and how easy it is to see on the screen. I was worried about shooting in direct sunlight, but as long as I looked over the top of my sunglasses, everything was clear. My only concern, and it would be a big one if I did not have my SLR, is that this camera is not good in low light. The camera uses ISO 1600 to get the picture, and there is way too much noise. You do get the picture, though, which is probably what most people want. I am just very fussy because I am used to gorgeous pictures with my Canon T1i in any kind of light. Granted, though, you have to set up those low light photos, and if people or objects are moving, you may not get the shot.I can not say anything about the video, as I have not used it yet. (Video is not important to me.)
