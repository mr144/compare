I bought this camera refurbished for around $130 I think. I got it just before an Ireland trip because I was taking an HD Video camera and did not want to lug around my big ancient Sony Digital XLR also. This camera was a little workhorse on the trip and stood up well to all the travel and rain. I will say you are not going to get absolutely incredible professional pictures with this camera of course but the lens and zoom were surprisingly good for dirt cheap and I took 1600+ pictures in Ireland that I can be completely content with for the rest of my life. The Lumix DMC - ZS8 was easy to use and has 25 or so automatic, easy-to-navigate settings that I used a lot to switch when I was in sunset, indoor, beach, and portrait situations.  They worked solid although you would probably be better served creating your own settings for certain situations so your pics will be more focussed towards your tastes. But it is still nice to have all these preprogrammed settings. The camera can be tweaked a lot also for users with more experience. What really surprised me was the video. There were a few situations I id not have the Handycam with me and took video and was shocked how good it was. Very good color and clarity you can see here: [...] Like most cheaper cameras it does a lot better in good light and outdoors but I did give it a C+ indoors. For what I needed it to do on a 12 day vacation it was like my right hand for the entire trip. It is also a great looking camera also and has a solid, well built casing. So far one of the best 'For Value' purchases I have ever made. As I said before it is a workhorse.
