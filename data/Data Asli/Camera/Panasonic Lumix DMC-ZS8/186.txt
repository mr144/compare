I bought this camera for a trip to South America thinking I would really like the long zoom lens and the 14 megapixels.  The problem is that my old 5 megapixel Canon takes better quality pictures both outdoors, but especially indoors.  There seems to be a problem with the software that processes the image which softens it up when you do not want it softened.  I have not purchased the similar Leica but a friend of mine has one and loves the picture quality.  I can not afford the Leica so will look at similar Canon cameras to replace this dog.
