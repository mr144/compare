quite frankly and most likely the best point and shoot you will find. Take into consideration the price ($243) and it is a hands down, no brainer.Took this to Colorado and was able to catch some beautiful shots both close ups with the wide angle and zooms with the 16x zoom. Did not think it was possible to get the quality resolution with a camera that does it all. Usually one virtue outweighs another but this is the best all arounder out there.Read other reviews on Amazon as well as cnet and other sited. This camera gets great reviews. BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! Oh and the video quality was unreal as was the battery life. I used an 8gig sd/hc card and was able to put well over a hundred photo's a day with short movies with hardly putting a dent on the memory. I downloaded the card daily but could have gone my whole trip 7days on one card I believe.
