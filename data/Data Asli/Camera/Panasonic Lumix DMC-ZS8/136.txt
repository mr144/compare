The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8 14.1 MP Digital Camera is nice enough for a small inexpensive camera.  However charging it is not easy.  Most things you just attach the charger plug to the camera, and the other end to the electrical outlet, or to a computer.  This one does not charge when you connect it to the computer.  It does not charge when you connect it to an outlet.  You MUST OPEN UP THE CAMERA AND REMOVE THE BATTERY, every time you need to charge the battery!  Then you MUST place the battery into a little compartment/charger and plug that into the electrical outlet.  Then when the battery is charged you take it out of the little compartment and open up the camera again, put the battery into the camera, close and lock the cover.  What a pain.  And if you are out and about you must make sure you brought that little compartment to charge the battery, you can not just bring the plug and plug in the camera to the computer or to the wall.  You must always take out the battery completely.  I do not like it at all.  The pictures on the Sony Cyber Shot are better, clearer, more detailed, but that one never held a charge for more than 12 photos!  So it went back to Amazon and I bought the Panasonic Lumix.  Since I am tired of calling, requesting, sending back, doing without a camera while waiting for them to mail it, I will keep this one.  But I truly believe that during our new trip, going to Austria, we will necessarily have to buy one of those disposable cameras when this battery needs charging during the middle of a sight seeing trip.  Other than this, it is an OK camera.
