Well, this is not what I expected from this camera.I have a Nikon D3000 and I was looking for a pocket camera for easy shooting in all conditions. The pictures come out blurry and out of focus even in daylight conditions at ISO 100, the HD movie mode is a bad joke looking like a cheap phone camera movie. I am shooting in P mode but I tried the rest of modes without any improvement and iA mode is even worse than all. If you want a serious camera, you have to pay more than 200 bucks and not for ZS series.
