An amazing piece of camera technology.  Took it with us on a cruise.  It made terrific images, both still and moving under all sorts of conditions - great sound capture too.  All this from a pocket-able camera? Wow!Wow, indeed. Three months after purchase a darkish fuzzy, nearly transparent rectangle has appeared just above the middle of the screen, is recorded in both still and video modes at most zoom settings.  Am about to contact Panasonic about it. Stay tuned.2 months later:Sent the camera to Texas for repair, it was repaired and then returned the slowest possible way, UPS Ground 5 business days.  All told it was gone for nearly a month.As for the problem.. It's fixed... yeaa.  But there's no accompanying explanation to tell me what caused the problem, what I should not do so it - the ghost image - will not recurn, only  Cryptic statements:  areplaced lense unit',  areplaced ccd'.There were, of course, no charges.  But clearly if this mysterious problem returns after the camera goes out of warranty, the cost to repeat this repair will be well above it is market value. So his remarkable little camera despite kid-glove handling, is very vulnerable to mysterious spontaneous damage to the lense unit and ccd, and is essentially an expensive disposable.I am trying to get a fuller description of the problem from Panasonic.  If I do it will appear here.Has anyone else experienced a similar problem?
