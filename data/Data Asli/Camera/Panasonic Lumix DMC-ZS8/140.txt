After USPS lost the first one of these I ordered, I finally got it. Maybe it was the poor excuse for packing (rattling around in a bigger box without so much as a piece of bubble pack) or maybe it is just a bad copy of an otherwise good camera. But mine took really bad pictures, on full auto, on semi auto, and full manual. In good light, in medium light AND on flash. Every picture was soft and grainy. Washed out color too. I actually could not find any redeeming features and I returned it. Was it my particular unit or the design? I do not know and past a certain point, I do not care. Maybe it is a quality control issue. With Leica optics, it ought to be good. Great specs. Just not even the minimum quality I can accept.
