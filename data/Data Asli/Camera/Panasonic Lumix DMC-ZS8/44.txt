This camera does everything a camera needs to do. It takes good pictures for the price. If you are looking for a higher quality camera... Get a DSLR. The zoom on this camera is perfect. I mean it can always zoom more but any real photographer knows if you can get closer... Do that. Also it has good features. Like I can change the ISO and the F stop. Honestly for me I really just use auto but my girlfriend is a photographer so using auto is not an option. I love the fact that I can hold the shutter button and it shows what the image will look like. Its pretty fast too. Also remember speed also comes from how fast your memory card is. If you have a slow memory card, the camera will be slow too. Another plus is that it can use a 64 gig memory card. You may ask why in the world would you need that big of a memory card... Well I went to Niagara Falls with this camera and if I did not have a computer I would have had one day of pictures... So if you do not have access to a computer than you want the most storage as possible. And while I am on the topic of Niagara Falls... This camera got wet from the falls. And I am not talking about dunked in water or one drop. It got pretty wet. I was worried the water would get into the lenses but it did not. Everything still works. I would not recommend doing that too much but the great pictures I got were totally worth risking the camera. (SD cards wont be affected by water as long as they are not being read or written to when it gets wet, some SD cards are even waterproof)Depending on where you buy it this camera can be an amazing deal. I got it at Sam's club and it came with a 4 gig sd card. For free that's not too bad. And Sam's club has better customer service so all the issues you people are having with returns... Sam's club is better.
