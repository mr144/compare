We were looking for a fast camera, we had enough shots of where something &#34;had been&#34; or the backs of people's heads.  This has WAY too many functions for me to figure out, but it has an intelligent auto that works great and the fast focus gets the pictures we used to miss.  Also using high speed memory which seems to be a must-have.
