Perfect for every day use. Ca not beat the 14 MP and the 16x zoom! I usually use a SLR camera with various lenses, however with a new baby and the weight of the camera, I wanted something convenient and light. I have not printed any pics yet but the quality on the screen looks great (compared to my professional Nikon camera).Since there is no manual focus, so you will not get perfect macro shots. Still, you can zoom in close enough to get decent details. I am mentioning this because I love shooting close up nature shots, which obviously are best with SLR and a macro lens.Update: I still love this camera, my toddler's portraits are of excellent quality. I did have an issue with spots on the lens, I mailed it to panasonic to be cleaned and they wanted to charge me 185$. Hubby found a video on YouTube showing how to clean the lens of that model (or very similar model), so we bought a tiny screw driver (at MarVac electronics) and a tiny  didust blower air pump cleaner', tadaa !! Lens is clean again.
