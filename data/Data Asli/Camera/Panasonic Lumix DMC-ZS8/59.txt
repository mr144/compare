This is an amazing little camera and I will surely not do it justice given my lack of knowledge about optics.  But here goes: The color and photo clarity are stunning.  Images are sharp -- even when I crop multiple times, or crop a few times and print a 12 x 16 photo.  People often marvel at the pictures I share or post on FB, and sometimes even make comments about my getting unsafely close to wildlife-thanks to the 16x zoom and 14 megapixels.  You can generally crop to your hearts content and get great images with good detail and minimal if any grain.  I do most of my 'photoshopping' in Picasa 3 (free download). Can only imagine what one coudl do wth a more powerful photo imaging system.  Thanks to the optical image stabilizer and intelligent auto mode (you can override iA settings in manual mode if you prefer), people and moving subjects rarely come out blurry in normal light settings.  This used to be a big headache with my previous Canon cameras (no one could seem to stay still long enough). In movie mode, images are quite good (even in relatively low light settings) and the sound quality is quite decent all things considered (have not tried in a large concert venue however). All this in a small camera that easily fits into most pockets or just about any purse. My only negative comment is that the door cover to the battery/memory card chamber is a bit flimsy and I take care to open and close it gingerly (since once that goes, it is generally curtains for your camera).  Be sure to bring a charger and extra battery when traveling, since this camera uses a proprietary Lithium ion battery (as opposed to AAs).  Despite these minor drawbacks, I am going to have to give this camer a 5 star rating and when this one goes kaput, will probably replace with another just like it.  P.S. Got this camera when it was relatively new on the market and paid around $250 for it.  Now it is a steal at under $200!
