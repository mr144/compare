I added this camera to supplement my Olympus E 520 SLR because I wanted a small camera to take along hiking. This camera does everything and more. The only thing that is missing, as with so many products today, is a small, maybe 4x6 Manual instead of the on line stuff. Something you could take along on a trip or read anyplace and be able to switch pages without having to fuss with keyboards.
