This is a great little camera. I went on to a butterfly house and the pictures of the butterflies came out gorgeous. The detail of each one was so amazing. I have larger, more expensive cameras, but this is the one I find myself going to more and more. It is especially great on walks and sightseeing as it is so light to carry. LOVE IT!!!
