I purchased this camera as a Christmas gift, and it was used maybe twice before it stopped working. I thought it may be a battery issue, but I ordered a replacement battery and charger and it still does not work. My best friend had an earlier model of the same camera, and she's had it for a few years with no problems, which is why I chose the Lumix. I did not realize until it was out of warranty that it was not just a battery, so now I guess I am just out of luck for this purchase.
