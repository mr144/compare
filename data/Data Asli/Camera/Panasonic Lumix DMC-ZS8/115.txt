DMC-ZS8 replaces a DMC-TZ3.  It is nice having very similar settings...with some extra features on the newer model.  The extra zoom is wonderful!  Only disappointment is what seems to be an even longer delay from picture snap to clearing of the LCD screen to capture the next picture.  I am still hoping there will be info somewhere to determine if there is a setting to shorten that delay.  Otherwise, this camera is everything one could want in a compact zoom point-and-shoot camera for travels and active grandchildren!
