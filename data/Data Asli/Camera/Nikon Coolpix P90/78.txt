After spending hours researcing the P90 here and on other sites,I was concerned as to my purchase.I made my purchase, on line on 27 November.My P90 was delivered today@ 9AM.I have joyfully spent the last fifteen (15) hours, with my professional photogropher neighbor using this camera.The ease of use and picture quality in auto and manual modes are just terrific.I just captured a few stellar shots of the full moon minutes ago.If one is conidering the purchase of a P&S,give the P90 a second look.I'M confident this one is a keeper.Way to go Nikon.
