I have always bought nikon. my recent purchase the nikon lens broke on the conector plastic tab that conects to camera body. I am very careful with my equipment. I mailed it back to Nikon as was only a couple of months old. They refuse to cover it under warrenty. It is new condition barely used and the plastic conector tab poor quality compared to their old style lenses. I am very upset that nikon will not honor their warrenty, have not mailed back my lens and will give no reason why on any matter. Nikon quality and customer care a zero. I am very suprised as have always been a faithful Nikon customer.
