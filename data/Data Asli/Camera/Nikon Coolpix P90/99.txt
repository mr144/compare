We got this camera specifically to take pictures of our hand crafted Malas and Rosaries, Necklaces and Bracelets.  We needed magnification that could show the intricate nature of our loops and twists and the beauty of our beads.  Although we are not professional photographers at all, we got beautiful pictures.
