I wanted to love this camera, I really did! I have had two Nikon Coolpix during the last 4 years and loved them, so I was excited to upgrade to the P90. I had read all the reviews on Amazon as well as other sites, and assumed that the people who were writing bad reviews of the camera just did not know how to use it.  I was wrong.First, I know it is a point and shoot camera and not a DSLR. But the quality of the photos the P90 took was terrible compared to my old Nikon Coolpix P5000. Unless I was outside with lots of natural light the photos from the P90 were all slightly blurred. Inside, I experimented with flash, no flash, Auto mode, P mode with ISO down to 64, reduced flash, heightened flash, adjusting the manual settings for the aperture, shutter speed, white balance and contrast. Could not get a good photo! And I have been using Nikons with the same features for years with no problem. Also, colors were too orange indoors, even with the flash.  Another reviewer said the photos looked like they were taken with a cell phone.  I thought this was exaggeration, until I saw some of my shots! Then I would take my old P5000 and shoot the same shot and it would come out perfect! I took over 400 photos with the P90 in two days, trying to see if the photos improved under any circumstances.  They did not. I am returning it to Amazon tomorrow. (Thanks for the painless return, Amazon!)You can see examples of what I am talking about at:http://www.flickr.com/photos/andyouandi/
