There are things about my P90 that I love.  I get incredible outdoor scenery shots and can zoom in on objects I can barely see with my naked eye and get detailed clarity. For example, we were at Devil's Tower, and I zoomed in on climbers near the top.  They were so high, it was easy to miss them.  I zoomed in just to see what I could get.  When I opened the pics in iPhoto, I could read the logos on their clothing!  That's some zoom capability.  Also this camera captures motion beautifully.  I take a lot of shots along the Lake Superior shoreline, and I have breathtaking pics of waves crashing on the rocks--you can see individual droplets sparkling in the air.  So for scenery and nature shots, this camera's great.  I also do a lot of 'artsy' close up work (flowers, leaves, etc), and the results are really beautiful.  Crisply focused with beautifully fuzzed backgrounds.But the bad?  This camera is horrible in bad light.  I have not gotten one good dusk or night outdoor shot, no matter the setting, and indoors when it is all artificial light, the results are bad.  Either a strange red/yellow glow or poorly focused.  I have tried every setting and can not get good indoor shots.  If it is daylight, I can get some nice ones with fairly true color, but with lights on in the house the camera can not seem to read correctly.So, if you are looking for a great, and I do mean GREAT camera for outdoors, this is it.  But if you want a party camera, the iPhone takes better pics.
