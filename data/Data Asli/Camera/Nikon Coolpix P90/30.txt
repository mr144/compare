I have had the camera for a few months now. Took the camera out on 3 occasions. Once downtown to test drive the camera. Loved the 24x zoom. Stood on the 16th floor of the hotel and took shots of downtown New Orleans. Picture quality was awesome. Second test drive was to my daughters fashion show. The outdoor shots were amazing. Indoor during the fashion show was horrible. Not sure if it was me, but I could not get any of the settings to give me a decent shot. Let me state this, I am a novice photographer at best. I am sure skills may play a major role here. The third test was taking the camera to Disney World. Again, the zoom and tilt screen came in really handing when trying to get a good shot of the characters during the parade. I was able to raise the camera above the crowds and just tilt down to aim my shots. The zoom switch was great for one hand handling. The auto focus or anti-shaking function (whatever it is called) saves the day. Having said all that, I always returned the camera to the carrying case when it was not in use which made it a bit of a hassle to try to snap something when I was on the rides. Only 2 stars for portability. Think I'll have to invest in a point and shoot pocket size cam. So, long story short. I highly recommend this camera.
