When I was going to France this last year, I was in the market for a new camera. I wanted a long zoom and a decent quality. I work at a retail store so I played with some cameras. I played with them (Kodaks, Canons, etc) I had a bad experience with Olympus so I did not want to go back with them. I was flipping through a flyer and I saw this camera. So I went over to get it but it was unavailable. I decided to take a shot and get it. I have never been happier with this camera. I can take far away pictures with great quality but I can also take close ups of flowers with near SLR quality. The picture quality in any picture is great. Some complain about 24x photos inside...thats because thats not the use for it. I have taken pictures of flowers, orioles, the moon, and a lot of other things. I would invest in this camera and an 8 GB memory card. You'll need it. The wide angle lens is a HUGE plus.The only cons to this camera is: its kinda big and heavy. There is also no sepia built into this camera.All in all, worth the investment. I have had nothing but luck with this camera and I love it.
