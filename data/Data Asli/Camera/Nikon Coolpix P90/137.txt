I had this camera over night shipped to me, just in time for my daughters wedding on the beach.  Excellent pictures and with this optical zoom these photos look professional.  As a matter of fact these pictures are every bit as good as the ones taken by the professional photographer at the wedding.  The lens lets in light so good that I have only used the flash once to just make sure it works.  The software that comes with it allows you to make panoramic pictures which is incredible how it is able to stitch the photos together to make one picture.  You can not tell where one photo ends and the next begins. I have already talked a co-worker into purchasing one.  Great CAMERA!!!!!
