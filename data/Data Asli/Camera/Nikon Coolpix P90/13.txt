This is a great camera, especially if you are new to photography. I got this camera just for fun, and you know what, I love it. I think it takes pictures just as a DSLR but its so much quicker since it is a point and shoot. Which is exactly what I need, I really do just point and shoot. It does take a little bit of getting used to, but if you read the guide real quick for the different modes, it is real easy to use. I have really come a long ways in my photography. I am only 13, and this is a great camera for me. I love it. :)
