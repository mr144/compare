Low cost, ($366.95 Shipped) full functioned, easy to use camera.I have an expensive professional Nikon setup ($3,500.00) with multiple lenses that is wonderful, but this camera delivers quality shots rapidly and with very little effort.It is much faster at the draw than my expensive setup because you never have to change Lenses. (I keep it in my truck so I never miss a Virginia wildlife shot) The Zoom is 26-624mm Optical, so you have a wide range to go along with the image stabilization and the quality 12.1 Megapixel pictures. It turns on quickly and works as it is supposed to.
