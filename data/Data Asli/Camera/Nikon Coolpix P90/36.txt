I just received this camera today and it appears to be a real beauty. First of all I am not a professional photographer so I really just needed a good, solid camera with high zoom capability and good resolution. The P90 fits the bill in all that. I am studying the manual today to learn how to use all the other features and capabilities and I am sure it will be a joy to use. My previous camera was a Kodak DX6490 which is a great camera but began acting a little flaky. So, it was time for a new, upgraded camera. The P90 has an excellent 'feel', very solid and a bit hefty which makes it seem like a  areal' camera. I took a few sample pictures and they look great. I got it from Amazon at a very good price compared to the local retailers in my area. Included are the battery, charger, lens cap, neck strap, A/V cable and USB cable. I had a 2 GB SD card which, according to the display, would hold about 350 pictures at the highest quality and resolution. I have ordered an 8 GB card and extra batteries so I will be prepared for the little league season coming up. The menu system is easy to use and the buttons/switches are all in the right place and easy to access. Unless there is something drastically wrong with this camera that I have yet to discover I think I will be very pleased with it.
