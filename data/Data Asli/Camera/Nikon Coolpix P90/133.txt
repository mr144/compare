Nikon Coolpix P90 is a wonderful camera for beginners or more advanced photographers. It's very easy to use on auto setting, and the 3' LCD screen is great for review. My favorite feature is the zoom, which makes picture taking so easy. My only complaint is that the rechargeable battery was not fully charged, so remember to buy a spare or charge it at home. The camera has exceeded our expectations in every way. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone. It's definitely worth the price for the zoom alone.
