This camera is just amazing.  When I first tried taking a few pictures with it, I realized two things.  I had the settings wrong and the flash was not up.  Unlike some point & shoots, the flash will not automatically go off when you take a picture.  Once I fixed those two issues and took more practice pictures using the camera guide along the way, I found it almost impossible to take a bad shot.  Highly recommend this camera for the more advanced photographer that may not want to bother with a traditional DSLR.
