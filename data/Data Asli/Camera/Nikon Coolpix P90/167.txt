The Nikon Coolpix P90 is what it is, a Point & Shoot Camera.  It is not a DSLR and was never designed to replace a DSLR.  This camera is the worst.. Duh!I do a lot of back country travel both in 4X4 vehicles and on foot and the P90 is a dream come true.  It's light and packs easily on my belt, it is versatile and the super zoom lets me frame shots without climbing all over a mountain.  It has easy to use controls and I can shift in seconds from a macro shot of a cactus blossom to an action shot of a javalina running along the river bottom.  I would love to take the DSLR guy on some of my hikes and let him pack a camera, tripod and three or four lenses around for the day.  I wonder who will get all the shots and who will still be several miles back trying to shift lenses!Honestly, I have been the whole SLR/Darkroom route and I have eight film cameras and a dozen lenses sitting in a box in the closet.  I started using digital cameras back when you paid a lot of money for a 2 megapixal camera.  I bought a Coolpix 4500 and took almost 3000 pictures with it.  I banged it around, dropped it in the dirt and it never stopped taking really good pictures.Nikon knows how to make great cameras and the Coolpix P90 is a great camera.  Do not let the 'flamers' fool you with their horrific reviews.  They buy a Point & Shoot camera and complain bitterly that it does not do the same thing a DSLR does.  Wow, I suppose the same person buys a Saturn and complains because it does not handle like a BMW M6.I have been playing with my new P90 and have over a hundred pictures in 5 days.  It's going to be a great camera and a fantastic travel companion.
