I have been an 'SLR' film guy since 1972.  I had been shopping for a digital SLR.  However, I noticed the Nikon P90 had many features in one camera that SLRs did not.  Although much smaller & lighter, the 26-624 MM zoom lens gave me great range without changing lenses.  At 12mp it gave me sharpness/detail equivalent to film which is important to me.  I just took this camera on a 3 week tour of Turkey.  I shot 650 pics @ high def on 8G card, with room for 720 more.  I had to re-charge battey only 3 times during the trip.  The electronic viewfinder shows what the lens sees, just like an SLR.  A great camera @ 1/3 the D90 SLR price & more features.  I highly recommend it.
