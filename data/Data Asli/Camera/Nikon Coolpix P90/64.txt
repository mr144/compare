The photo quality is not that much good as that of canon has in the same range.But when we take snaps in the day time, they are good but when you take in dark even with flash, the quality is poor.The 24x zoom makes the most but still the photo quality is a drawback. Canon in the same range would be a better choice.For me, since I got this for a less price(deal), this is OK for me.
