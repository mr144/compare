I am amazed by the number of negative reviews for this camera. Many complaints are either that the reviewer has a DSLR that takes shots with less noise or that the reviewer has an old, less expensive camera that takes better pictures. My response to the first type of complaint is 'DUH!' and to the second type is that the user simply does not know how to operate a full-featured camera.I am not a Nikon guy, per se, so I am not defending Nikon simply because it is a Nikon. I was actually considering a Canon SX10 or SX1, but I chose the P90 because I wanted the time-lapse movies and timed-interval still shots. Neither of the Canons has those two features. My pictures look fine for a less-than-$400 camera, and under all lighting conditions. I know I could get less noise and better detail at ISO 1600 with a camera that costs two or three times as much and requires me to change lenses to get the focal length range of the P90. But, I did not spend a lot of money, and I rarely print larger than 8x10, so I have no complaints whatsoever.
