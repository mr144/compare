Ca not say enough about how great this camera is! Do not waste your money on the D40's, you'll spend twice as much on a camera that does not do half as much as the 90 does. It is functional, fast, and flexible! It is not hard to pick up and start taking great pictures, and if you read the book a couple times through you pretty much know everything you need too to take the best pictures you could want. Buy it and become your own photographer for weddings and portraits. I did!
