This is a great camera for beginners. I have taken some nice shots that people have mistaken for a DSRL camera. Since it is coolpix the lense cannot be changed which sucks but it is still a great camera and has lots of effects. Some of my sample pictures can be viewed at capturesouls.tumblr.com. Overall If you want a nice camera at an affordable price with good megapixel this is it.
