Always wanted a nikon camera and this is my first .Have not checked all the features but ,as of now I find it a great camera for its catogory. The one complaint that I read before I purchased the camera was about picture quality and that it was not up to par. I find found this not to be the case with what I have seen so far in the photos I have taken ,again ,not alot of varied use to date but if it preforms to what I have seen so far ,I am more than happy with the camera
