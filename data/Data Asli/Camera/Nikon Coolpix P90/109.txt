I have purchased this camera recently and find the product to be beyond my expectations. In my opinion it is not a point and shoot, it offers much more. You have to take the time to educate yourself on the features and capabilities of this product. Nikon has developed a fine product that I highly recommend.So far image quality,build and options are outstanding.
