I have owned several Nikon Digital Cameras and was considering an  SLR when I read the reviews on this camera. It is everything and more than promised. I just returned from a trip to Italy and the pictures are the best I have ever taken.  The wide angle is not quite as wide as my old Nikon 5000 with a wide angle lense and adaptor, but more than sufficient.  In Paris I was able to photograph the entire facade of Sacre Cour standing in front of it.  The sports feature is incredible. I used it to take pictures of my grand daughters little league game. I got every step of her bat swing and each picture was clear and in focus. It took 15 pictures in less than a minute. This is a great camera.
