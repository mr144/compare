This is a wonderful point and shoot camera. Just returned from Turkey and needed all functions I could master up to this point. Exceptional zoom capabilities. Only issues were in low light. Pictures were grainy but I discovered a work around by fiddling with the camera. Have found use the tilting LCD screen a real aid to shooting in crowds and 'candid/subject unposed' shots. I am still discovering features. I recommend this highly for those who do not want to step up to a DSLR.I caught it on a day when the price was in the high 200's. Still a great camera at higher price.
