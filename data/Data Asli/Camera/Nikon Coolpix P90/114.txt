Being a dedicated Nikonist, I was somehow disappointed with the coolpix P80 which I still own (and do not intend to give it up). However from the first photos I took with the P90, I fell in love with that cam. It has great picture quality, very fast focus, great wide angle features (for outdoors), and the best zoom I ever saw on a camera without the hassle of changing the lenses on a DSLR (I have then Nikon D70s). The handling is much more improved over the P80 and lots of features added. I highly recommend the P90 to any outdoor and wildlife photographer. It's worst every penny of the price. I'll be using this cam for a long time to come.
