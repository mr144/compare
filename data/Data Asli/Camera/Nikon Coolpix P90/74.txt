Short, sweet and to the point! I LOVE my new Nikon!  As an early wedding, Christmas, birthday present to myself, I bought the Nikon P90!  Okay, so really I told people that it was 'saved' in my shopping cart and when I was buying a lightning deal, I just checked out with the camera too! (shhh..do not tell anyone!)I like my camera's simple and easy to use with sharp images. I got exactly that!  Excellent!  My first shot out of the box was crystal clear!  No adjustments, no settings - I did NOTHING but point and shoot!  Wow - it was sooooooooo clear! I will post that picture for you all to see!My only regret?  I did not buy it sooner!
