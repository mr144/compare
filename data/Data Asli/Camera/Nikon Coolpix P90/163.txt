I was planning to buy a high end point and shoot camera, not a DSLR one and I found Nikon P90 had all my requirements and even more...Picture quality is stunning and low light pictures turn out great...Flash is excellent. 12.1 mp and 24X Zoom are the main high lights.LCD Screen looks ok.. no match to Canon and Sony...but its not fair expect all great features :-)I had Sony and Canon prior to this and I would rate this as my best one.I really love this Nikon P90... its so handy that you can grab it up where ever you go
