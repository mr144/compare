Very disappointed with this camera. Tried two of them and both had poor picture quality. My old Panasonic camera was far superior to this Nikon. I was once a photographer and used Nikon equipment. They had some of the best 35mm stuff. But I am not impressed with their digital stuff.Very happy with Amazon customer service. It is the best and saved me a lot of hassle. Would buy from Amazon again
