Pros: It has incredible zoom capabilities, and it takes some of it is best pictures in natural light and at night. The colors are vibrant, and vivid. The wide-angle lens is spectacular! MUCH better than Cannons and Kodak cameras I have had in the past.Cons: The motion sensibility is a little touchy when you zoom in. Indoor pictures can use a little touch up. The LCD screen does not show would good the picture really is. It might look too bright on the screen, but on the computer and prints are great.Overall: I bought it for my wedding, as the main camera to get the wedding pictures and I can say that I and my wife have no problems with the results. The indoor pictures could be a bit better, but you have to read and re-read the manual to get that set up properly. The zoom is fantastic if you are talking still shots, but with action shots, make sure you do not zoom in too closely.They have very good color ratios and very quick shutter speed (which was very important to me). If you like to catch shots in the moment and catch the natural expressions of people, this is the camera to get.
