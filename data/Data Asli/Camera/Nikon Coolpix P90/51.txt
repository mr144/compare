This is the perfect camera for someone who is not a professional yet wants some shots that a digital camera with minimal zoom options just can not get. I specifically got it to take pictures of my children especially when they have performances and I need to zoom. It is obviously a little bulkier than my digital so I will not likely take it to disney or anything, but to take pictures at my childs birthday party or take it to the park for snap shots it has had amazing quality!! I love it! Exactly what I wanted. I am still figuring out all the features of what it can do but am impressed so far.
