I need a camera that is ready in an instant. When hiking in the back country I do not have time to mess with settings when an eagle fight suddenly happens in the sky above me. This camera is a little slow for this kind of use, it requires settings and knowledge of camera attributes. Even the point and click setting is not 100% auto focus so you have to make sure you are focused before you shoot. Once I get to know the camera I am sure to get tons of terrific shots because the quality of the photos is terrific. Definitely a great camera for stationary tripod type use, a little less so for use on the spur of the moment until I get the multi-photo option figured out. In general I love the camera. The battery lasts very, very well when used with the monitor off which is what I need for week long hikes. The video quality is not so great, but that's not why I bought it. I am a little disappointed with the zoom. It does not appear to get me any closer than my 15x zoom on my Kodak. When I tried testing it against the Kodak, I could not get clarity on the focus at the same distance. I will try again now that I have used the camera a bit more and understand the settings better. Probably user error.
