I have seen a lot a reviews abt nikon p90 being horrible in low light. Its because of High ISO. And if anybody knows about High ISO then they would knowing that its also associated with noise. Nikon detects the amount of light and automatically increases the ISO. If you do not want noise, do not select auto mode. try with programmed auto so you get options to decrease the ISO.
