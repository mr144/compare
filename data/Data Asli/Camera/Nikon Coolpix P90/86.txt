I thought the tilt LCD was a gimmick I did have little use for until I mounted the camera on the tripod the first time.  No more bending over to look through the view finder or the LCD display, it tilts so that you can stand upright looking down at the LCD and focus and adjust the camera as necessary.  It is also very handy when taking photos when you have to hold the camera above your head to view over brush or branches in the way.Two things I was disappointed in were night shots without flash and the software provided.  The camera has the capability to operate at very high ASA settings which should allow better pictures at night, but the camera does not automatically adjust this way when in the program mode - I need to study further to make it work.  The software supplied is basically a transfer program, no editing functions that I could find.  You can edit the pictures on the LCD, but I did rather work on a 17' monitor than on a 3' so I use the software provided with my Olympus camera.
