I have had many Nikon digital cameras, happy with all of them.I purchased the P90 to replace my wife's stolen P80.We were very happy with the P80 and figured I would just upgrade to the new model.Overall picture quality was poor, coloring was no where near  areal life', mostly very yellow.Playing with the limited settings might get a decent picture but as soon as the lighting changed it was back to poor color.I returned it after only 1 week and had it replaced with another P90, thinking it was obviously defective.We used this replacement for about 3 weeks with only slightly better results, but still totally unacceptable.The second P90 was also returned, this time for a refund.Highly UN-recommended.Duane
