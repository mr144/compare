Unfortunately I was not pleased with this camera. I have had camera phones take better quality pictures. This is nothing more than an over sized point and shoot camera. Even after adjusting the settings to go with the room lighting (whether indoors or outdoors) this camera just did not cut it for me. I eventually upgraded to a Nikon D5000. This is the entry level DSLR camera. Other good ones are Nikon D3000, D3100, D40, and D60.
