I am no photo fan. I just wanted to own a powerful, easy to use, high quality camera to shoot family portraits, places I visit, and some engineering projects I am managing. My Nikon Coolpix P90 succesfully fulfilled all I needed. After playing with the camera, it became natural tu use it. I shooted some great photos. I plan to learn more about it so I can take full advantege of its multiple options.Alejandro Koweindl
