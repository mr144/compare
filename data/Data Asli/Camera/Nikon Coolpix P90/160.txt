If you take the time to learn this camera thoroughly, you'll get outstanding pictures. If you want an out of the box, fully auto, point and shoot, then buy a little pocket point and shoot! The P90 has manual assist settings that let you shoot close to DSLR. Be patient, read the manual, you'll love your photos! Bravo Nikon!
