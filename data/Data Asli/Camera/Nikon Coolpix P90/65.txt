I am a point and shoot user and have had good luck with smaller cameras.  I decided I wanted to get a little more involved with my photography and upgrade a little from the smaller styles.  I have two smaller (fit in your pocket small) that do a MUCH better job than this camera.  The pictures are not as clear, the background coloring is off, and 9 out of ten times the pictures are blurry.  The auto feature is the worst setting of all.  The ones you set up yourself are not much better.  I mean if you are taking a shot of an inanimate object and have all day to try all the settings, you might get a somewhat decent shot, but if you were touring a city for example, 90% of your pictures would be crap.  You have to pop the flash up yourself, even if you have it on auto- it will not pop up if needed, nor will anything appear on the screen to tell you that you might want to use it.  I defintely do not recommend this camera and whole heartedly regret purchasing it!  I really wish I had not thrown out the box so I could have sent it straight back!
