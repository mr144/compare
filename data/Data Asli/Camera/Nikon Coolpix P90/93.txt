I have read the others reviews about the picture quality, and I do not agree with them. This camera have a great picture quality, the only problem is that is not easy to use. You have to study the manual and learn how to use it well, because it have so many options that you need to know when is the ocasion to use it.For outdoor pictures is amazing, for indoors pictures you have tu use the indoors scene mode.When you use the 24X of zoom you'll need a tripod (this is the problem of all the ultra zoom cameras) to get a amazing picture.The only bad options that I found in this camera is the sport shooting mode. The only way to get a great photo is to take it with a lot of day light, otherwise the photos are going to be very poor in quality.This is a great camera, but you need to learn how to use it. Now if you want to take photos without having to configure the camera you should buy the Canon SX10 that works great in automatic mode. But if you want to learn more about photography and to use all the options of a camera, then the Nikon P90 will be the best option for you.
