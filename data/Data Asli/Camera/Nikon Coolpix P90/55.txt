I think very highly of this camera. The photos I have taken have turned out very, very nice. I am looking forward to using this at a couple concerts in the next few months and the hiking, backpacking and camping I'll do this summer with my dog. The instruction manual is easy to understand. I have wanted a Nikon for many years and I am glad I bought this one.
