Even though I am not familiar with all of the features this camera is awesome. Usually I have grown tired of my 'new digital camera' by this point but the P90 is still tops for me.I am not one that is big on making a camera smaller and smaller. I feel that if a camera is bigger then the buttons are easier to use. It is just my personal preference though.I also love how long the rechargeable battery lasts. I can let it sit for weeks and pick it up and it is still ready to go.The adjustable monitor is great! I take pictures for my technical training courses that I develop and deliver for my work. Sometimes I need to be right down on the floor to get the best possible angle. With the tilting scroon I no longer have to get right onto the floor to get these shots.If you want a reliable and durable camera, this is it!
