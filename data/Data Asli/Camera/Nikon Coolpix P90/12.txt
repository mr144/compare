Wow, I can not say enough about the CoolPix P90. If you are looking for a less-expensive, super high quality camera, look no further. I have a high-end Nikon D300 for sports action photography (and professional quality shots), yet I take the P90 anytime the need to capture higher-speed or more detailed photography is not there. I am always impressed with the quality of the pictures that I get with this camera. In lower light settings (e.g. a concert, or other indoor event)---or even a well-lighted sports contest---you can still get some GREAT shots, you just have to be willing to take a lot of shots, anticipate the action, and be steady. Overall, for a 'vacation' camera (i.e. for 90% of the things most people want a camera for), I can not imagine an SLR, for the price, that can top the P90. And it has enough SLR settings that an expert can also tune it up for some pretty spectacular advanced photography! Best portable I have seen.
