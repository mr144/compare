Of the 'point and shoot' cameras on the market today, this is undoubtly the best.  Love the 600mm telephoto lens.  The pictures are extremely sharp even when cropped and enlarged.  Most of the time, it is best to put automatic and let the camera to it thing.  However, it also work wonderfully on both aperature and speed priority for those times when special treatment is desired.The only two drawbacks is that one cannot readily attach filters to the lens (for instance a UV filter to protect the lens) and the picture on the viewfinder and screen is not nearly as clear and sharp as what the picture actually.If one wants something a bit better than the simple point and shoot cameras and particularly with a great telephoto lens, this is the one to buy.  I highly recommend this camera.Note:  watch out how much telephoto you use.  A tripod is needed when going much past 200mm.
