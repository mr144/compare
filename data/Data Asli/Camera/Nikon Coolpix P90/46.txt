I have always loved Nikon and previously owned a S8700 which was fantastic until it just stopped working.  So I went about looking for a Nikon and ended up selecting the P90 because all I wanted was a point and shoot with great zoom.  Well little did I know that I would be sacrificing picture quality!!  Cannot get myself happy with the quality of the pictures at all and would sincerely love to return this!!
