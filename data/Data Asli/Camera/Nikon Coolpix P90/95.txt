I read several reviews about the camera and I was not sure about buying it... but I am usually like that, so a friend forced me to finally buy it. When I first got it and took a few pictures with it, they looked pretty lame in the camera, then I got the time to load them to my computer and WOW! Quality. For a professional photographer this camera could be unimpressive but I am a filmmaking student and I needed something for my photography classes. I first had the time and chance to handle it at class. My teacher just talking, telling us what to do and me trying to figure out how to use it... which I learned to do pretty quick so that means it is easy to use. I have had this camera for almost two months and until now I have not regretted buying it.Also there was an easy with the package being delivered, since I am outside of the States. But they were kind enough to refund me $10 and give me a free memory, that made me feel secure with my purchase through Amazon.
