Image quality sucks bad. Lots of noise. Poor quality.I bought this the day it came out as a gift. The view finder screen is so pixilated it seems like the 80's were making a comeback.The images when transferred faired no better. I got a few okay pictures under great lighting conditions. Anything near bad light with a flash looked like it was taken with a cell phone camera. I returned the camera right away.
