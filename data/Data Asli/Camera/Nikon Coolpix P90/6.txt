Easy to use for the novice, just point and click. But also has advanced features that seasoned photographers will find value in. I have owned this camera for 2 years now and I love the images it produces. Love that the LCD screen moves up and down so I do not have to get on a step stool or bend down to take pictures at different heights and see the image. Excellent zoom/digital zoom and very good vibration control. I have taken it with me to China, Hawaii, Mexico and India. It is rugged and durable as my children and I have dropped it a few times but it just keeps on going strong. All in all, this is a great camera, with excellent quality for the money. You cannot go wrong with it.
