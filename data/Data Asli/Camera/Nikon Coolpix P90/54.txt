I am an amateur photographer.  I just wanted a good point and shoot with specific features.  The most important feature I wanted was a great zoom.  The 24x is awesome.  Clear, crisp shots from soooo far away.  My second must have feature was a large LCD screen.  The 3' was the best I could find - and it makes photo taking much easier (my last Nikon 4800 which I had for many years had a teeny 1 or 1 1/2' screen).  I always like to have a camera with a viewfinder - for those bright, sunny outdoor shots.  This camera has it.  The menu is easy to navigate; even my technologically-challenged husband is able to use it.  I especially like how the LCD screen angles out for difficult shots.  It also makes it easier for you to take surprise shots of people while you are sitting inconspicuously!  Although you can just take it out of the box and begin shooting photos, it does take some getting used to.  I read through the manual thoroughly and bought a book on digital photography.  You just have to play with it for a little while; take photos in all sorts of situations with the different settings, find the settings you like.  When you find them, then there's two buttons, U1 and U2 (user 1 and 2) that you can set your preferred settings.  The battery life has been good.  I purchased a 4G memory card which is more than enough for me.  You have to take the lens cap off yourself, and push a button to bring up the flash, but again that just takes getting used to.  The camera is comfortable to hold and it is not as heavy as I expected it to be.  Amazon had the best price for this camera!  I am very pleased with it.  I have had other brands of point-and-shoot cameras, but always seem to go back to Nikon.
