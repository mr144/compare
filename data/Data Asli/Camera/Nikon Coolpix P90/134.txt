I am returning this product.  Wow, silly me....  It never occurred to me that Nikon would produce a 12 mega pixel camera with a 24x optical zoom and NOT have included the ability to shoot RAW.  Why?  Maybe they did not want it to compete with their more expensive SLRs.  I should have been more careful reading the specs before I bought it.  I was looking for a nice alternative to my D100 (a great camera but now outdated).  So, for the money, my bet is now with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28K. It has 18x zoom, 10 mega pixels, it can be used with manual settings as well as point and shoot plus it shoots RAW.  It also sports Leica optics.  There it is, learn from my mistake.  This Nikon would have been a great camera-perfect really..... but alas!
