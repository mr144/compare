First understand that I am an electronic idiot. Second, I know nothing about cameras. I bought this camera because I wanted to take close ups of my cats, roses and favorite places. Historically I have had difficulty with cat pictures because the cats either close their eyes or leave the picture when they hear the camera click. Now I can take pictures of the cats when they are farther away. I can zoom in on the cats and take great pictures as they are not reacting to the shutter noise. The detail is good. The cat whiskers show up sharp. I am getting the best pictures I have ever taken. I am very happy with this camera. The only down side is it does not fit into my purse but I can always get a larger purse.
