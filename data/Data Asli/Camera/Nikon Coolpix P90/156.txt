I liked many things about this camera - light weight (maybe a bit too light), rechargeable, lightweight battery, 24x zoom, 12 megapixels, etc. - but the pictures were terrible. I take a lot of landscapes and plant close-ups. Greens tended toward yellow, purple toward blue. In fact, a dark purple pansy that came out moderately light blue was the final straw. The 24x zoom sounds great, but in reality, the pictures at 24x tended to be a bit fuzzy, even when taken in full sunlight. Indoor pictures tended to be grainy.I returned the Nikon for a Canon SX10IS, which has far superior picture quality, at least in my hands. I strongly recommend NOT buying the Coolpix P90; despite its undeniably good aspects, it just does not measure up in picture quality.
