I have owned a number of cameras, film and digital, including a Nikon D50. I also have a Sony A350. Both of the aforementioned cameras do great pictures but they are bulky and they are heavy with lens attachments that do anything close to what this compact outfit does.  I walk a lot about lakes where thee are a variety of Eagles, Ospreys, hawks, and water fowl. I can whip out my P90, and fill a frame with an eagle on a limb and freeze it.  I have decided to make the P90 my main 'carry along' camera for my walks where I might see a bird or animal I want to capture. I highly recommend it. One thing I was caught off guard by is that it uses the newer HC SD cards, which will not work in the Nikon D50 and may not work in older memory card readers either. I found that out quickly trying to import pictures into my computer to edit. Get a new SD card reader when you buy the camera. The camera also does NOT come with a memory card, I assume to hold down the buying price. A 2 GB card is plenty of capacity. Why buy a 4 GB or higher when your battery capacity will not begin to fill it.
