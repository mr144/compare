I tried out this camera, excited because I found a comparable Nikon to my canon S3IS that I could now have all Nikon equipment.  I was VERY disappointed with this camera's autofocus feature and with how slow it focused, as well as the LCD screen resolution - it seemed to vibrate and was not very clear. It simply would not focus properly and would not focus on what I desired.  It was honestly the biggest disappointment I have ever had in a Nikon product.  I own 5 Nikon cameras, a Nikon F3 HighEyepoint, a D50S, two D80s and a point and shoot.  I love all my other cameras, but this one, no - and it went back to the store.
