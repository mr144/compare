This camera has sparked my interest as a photography hobbyist. The zoom issues described in previous reviews are easily solved by tweaking the iso, aperture or shutter speed. The camera also has several settings such as aperture or Shutter priority modes to assist with evenly regulating exposure making it easy to use for 1st timers. After reading the manual every picture i took came out in amazing quality. The tilt screen makes taking pictures at impossible angles easy. The 24 inch zoom lets you take close ups from impossible lengths. it also comes with Vibration reduction to stabilize said zoom shots Noise reduction to help when high iso is necessary. Auto and manual whitebalance settings In camera digital lighting and editing.This camera may not be a DSLR but in my opinion it takes pictures just as well with half the effort.
