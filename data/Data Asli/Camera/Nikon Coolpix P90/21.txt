I have owned this camera for over a year now.I use it when I do not want to be carrying my heavy DSLR with its lenses.I find the image quality to be very decent. The vibration reduction works well.If you have only been using the auto mode on your point & shoot camera, you can continue to do so with the P90 but it also allows you to use more advanced controls and learn how to improve your photography skills.I also bought a P100 recently as a gift to a friend.The P100, replacing the P90, is just as good, with improvement in video and also a slightly more powerful zoom.I would recommend both models but looks like the P90 is no longer produced.
