Wonderful camera: Out of the box it works and works well. I have taken over 300 pics in regular auto mode and as long as the brackets are green the pictures are good.  I get a kick out of the sport mode shooting birds or the dogs or the grandkids is just wonderful. My old camera was the Fujifilm Finepix A800 it is not a bad camera but the color was never quit right, bright reds and low blues were almost always off. The P90 is color sharp and so far looks clean.  The Nikon P90 zoom is great I still smile from ear to ear when I am out back looking at a bird in the tree and can just keep zooming in till it fills the screen and the color is just WOW.  Looks like the Grandkids will be getting another handmedown camera. I have a lot to learn about all the settings but with the manual and podcasts I seem to be well on my way. Oh and I will never be getting a DSLR when this works so well. The Nikon P90 is almost the last point and shoot I will ever get.  Well at least till I see what they do next year.One gripe would be the video. It's almost like they have a deal with the video camera guys that says it will be the worst possible thing to do with this camera would be to use it for a video clip.  I do not think it could get much worst and still have the option on the dial.  Fix the video Mr. Nikon.If you do the point and shoot thing get this one. It's on the pricey side but it seems to be well worth the price for what it does.
