Picture and stabliztion is good overall a very good camera.  However, I brought this camera for the camera as well as for the quick video feature and the video quality was not very good and the zoom feature did not work for the video like for pictures.  I thought because the pixels were higher for pictures the videos well also be better but I was very disappointed by the video quality.  I am thinking now I have to buy a camcorder for the better video.
