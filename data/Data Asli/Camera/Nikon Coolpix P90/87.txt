This is the second P90 I bought, because my wife want this camera too. It's very easy to use and for me and my wife the picture quality is good enough, though I know the reviews from people complaining about the picture quality. Before I had (still have) and old professional SLR, but the little weight from the Nikon compared to the old SLR make it very clear to me and I do not use the SLR any more. In this camera you have all in one and if you are a nature photographer and do not want to carry a lot of stuff this camera is worth thinking in it. After more than thousand photo's with my P90 I am very satisfied, I can make almost every picture I want at my trips and this is the main reason I have this type of camera.
