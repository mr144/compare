I have had my P90 for two weeks now and after doing my usual tests with a new camera I am very pleased. This is NOT a DSLR so do not expect equivalent quality photos but for an advanced point and shoot it is excellent.Good:1) Gotta love that zoom range! True wide angle to super-telephoto with fast response time.2) Four-way image stabilization works as advertised and I have taken nice sharp photos at the long end of the zoom.3) Tilting LCD screen is great for macros.4) Scene modes for just about everything if you are into that kind of thing.5) Has a usable electronic viewfinder with diopter adjustment.6) Lens has ED glass and a relatively fast f/2.8 speed.7) Looks bulky but is very lightweight which I appreciate during long shooting sessions.8) Shooting at ISO 64 to 200 produces very pleasing colors with good sharpness and little discernible noise.Needs Work:1) LCD could use more pixels but it is more than usable.2) ISO is usable up to and including 400 but after that things break down quickly. 800 still usable but you'll need post-processing to get rid of some of the noise.3) LCD screen is nice at 3' but needs more pixels to compete with similar cameras.4) You have to delve into one of the menus to change ISO settings but it does feature two selectable auto ranges which cover most situations.5) Wish it had a live histogram and not just one on the previews.
