I have shot about 2000 pix with the P90 now and I am loving it.The lens has fantastic range from a good wide angle to a get in close zoom.  The LCD and Viewfinder work well even in sunlight.  Shooting is very responsive for this price range bit a slight shutter lag reminds you that you did not pay $1000 or more.  Controls allow you to go from point and shoot mode to full photographic freedom.The P90 provides the owner with a very portable yet powerful camera.  A similarly capable SLR camera would be very heavy, much larger and cost a great deal more.  Compare the P90 price, size and weight with a 26-624mm 35mm lens for your SLR and you will see why I love this camera.  Chances are you will need two or more lens to cover that range and each one that is 'Nikkor Quality' will cost more than the P90.Finally, a few words for those that want something negative (or proof that I do not work for Nikon;-).  The LCD has a limited tilt range that hinders my ability to shoot at full arms length at any angle.  In low light focus time is about 1 to 2 seconds.  You must remove the lens cap before you turn on the camera.  Colors are not always 100% accurate (NO digital camera is) but the colors are GOOD when light is reasonable.  No hot shoe.
