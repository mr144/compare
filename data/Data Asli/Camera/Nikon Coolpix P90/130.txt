Having used the Nikon P90 for a couple of weeks, I can honestly say I am 100% satisfied with its performance.  I own a Nikon film SLR and find the performance/quality of the P90 to be comparable or better.  I find its features easy to use right out of the box.  It is definitely worth spending the time to go through the manual for the finer performance details, however, it is not essential if you simply want to put the camera in auto mode and zoom into all of those shots that you wanted to take with your point & shoot but were just too far away.  No problem with the P90!  The clarity/color of the superzoom shots you take are simply breathtaking.  Unless you are the type willing to pay, and knowledgeable enough to figure out, the $1500 + digital SLR, you will not notice the subtle improvements the digital SLR will provide. This camera is the worst. The zoom, sports 'burst' mode & panorama assist are the features I love the best.  This is an incredibly versatile camera.  The only drawback, if you can call it a drawback, is its size.  It will not fit in your pocket.  But find me a camera that performs like the P90 and fits in my pocket and I'll buy it!  Do yourself a favor, buy this camera.  You will not be disappointed!
