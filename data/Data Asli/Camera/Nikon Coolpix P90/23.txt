I am an amatuer photographer and at the time I bought this one I was looking for something inexpensive with decent quality that was easy to learn on.  That's exactly what I got and more!  I love this thing although it would be great if it had more analog and manual settings but aside from that its a great camera.  Picture quality is awesome, zoom is amazing and the tilting LCD screen is the best thing ever, I use it all the time.  Worth buying this one if you are looking for something semi professional and very easy to use.
