I looked at several cameras and read lots and lots of reviews before deciding on the P90. While some of the reviews talked alot about noise in the pictures I had no problems whatsoever. I did have some in the beginning but once I messed around with ajusting the settings it was great, took over 600 pictures on a recent trip to Egypt and very little if any were deleted due to noise. The zoom feature on this camera is great! overall I gave it a 4 (high 4) as I do not believe there will ever be a perfect camera.
