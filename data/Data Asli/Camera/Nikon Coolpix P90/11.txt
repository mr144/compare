I agree with every one star comment made. I have been using Nikons since 1968(Nikon FTN) I currently use a Nikon D300 and a D200 and a range of Nikon Lens. This is ,witout doubt, the worst camera I have ever used. I bought this for my wife and I use it when I climb. The biggest problem is it will not focus and this is only one of the many problems already mentioned. If somebody trys to give you one refuse it. It's that bad.
