I bought this camera from Amazon before 6-7 months. My experience with this product so far is ok ok.Pros:-1. Takes good pictures outside during sunny weather2. Good zoom 24xCons:-1. Started appearing verticle lines in LCD while viewing2. Takes very poor pictures inside or during night (I am not sure if I am missing any settings but I have used Nikon products in the past)3. Not worth of the costI would suggest viewers to check out different options.RegardsNir
