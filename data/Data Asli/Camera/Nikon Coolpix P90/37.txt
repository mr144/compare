I have big hands and I shake alittle when holding something for very long. My Coolpix P90 is just what I had been looking for. Now I can take pictures of my Grandbabies and secure my stuff for insurance purposes. The reconditioned camera was in my price range and I could not be more pleased. My Garnddaughter had just purchased the same one several weeks ago and I saw the results. It takes great pictures and it is easy to use. Thanks Amazon.com Johnny McGuire
