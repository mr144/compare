I have played with the camera for a few days testing its strengths and weaknesses. Its strongest point is its incredible zoom. If you set the digital zoom setting to crop, it extends the zoom capability to over 800 mm without degrading the quality of the pictures. I never usually use digital zoom but in this camera I was able to get clear shots hand held that were still sharp at over 600mm. I really wanted to compare this camera's zoom capability to my Nikon D200 with its 18-200 lens. At times I crop the shots taken on the D200 at a high magnification. I did not want the weight or the cost in a 600mm or greater lens for the D200. This camera was able to fill that need. Its only down side is trying to capture high speed shots taken in the sports mode. In all the shots the highlights are completely blown out. This is the reason to have 2 cameras, the DSLR for high speed shots and the 'bridge camera' for the extreme zooms. I am very happy with this purchase. I wish I could include sample shots.
