I was trying to upgrade from a Canon Powershot S5 IS, and this looked like the right choice. I was tired of the red halo effect the digital Canon has consistently given me in the cameras I have purchased from them in the last ten+ years, and wanted to switch manufacturers in hopes of ridding myself of that bane.My Nikon arrived, and my first thought as I raised it from the box was, wow, this is light. Not in a good way. I tried the camera in low to moderate light - it took a long time to focus, and many shots turned out blurry. The camera was working hard to take the pictures. I tried the camera in bright daylight. Near shots were overexposed, and zoomed shots again took a long time to focus, and still turned out blurry. And the insidious red halo returned on the white patch of a duck's face. In addition, I could not really tell if the pictures I was taking were in focus, or even on the screen completely, when I was at max zoom. On my Canon, at max zoom I did not have the images clear before I snapped the shot - but when I looked at the screen the resolution was much clearer and the image stabilization more effective.Yes, I know the soom is not as great - and that comparing the max of one to the other is not a fair comparison. Yes, there may be settings internal to the camera to help resolve these issues. But the technology leap I was expecting, something to make the new camera as good as the old with the bonus of greater rez and greater zoom, did not happen.
