She put this on her christmas list. that meant I had no input into the decision. Usually I compare and contrast various models of high tech devices before purchasing them. So I did not even look at the camera online, I just bought it.Anyway, it got here and she loves it. It is really easy to take a picture. It is not easy to get the camera prepared to take a picture. There is a big lens cap you have to take off, you have to press a button to pop up the flash. And if you turn on the camera and leave the lens cap on, the lcd screen says you have to turn the camera off and take the lens cap off and turn the camera back on. kind of annoying.Besides all that, it really does take great pictures. My wife was jumping up and down with how fast it shoots. We got a picture of our 8 year old in mid ollie (skateboard jump), they were both totally stoked. We have 3 little kids and you have to take a picture really quick sometimes if you want a cool picture. The P90 is really quick. and it takes a motion jpeg movies, so that's a plus.In short, I like the camera and am glad i bought it. I think it was worth it.
