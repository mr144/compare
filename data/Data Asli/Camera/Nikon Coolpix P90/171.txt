I recently bought this camera from Amazon US and found that the shots that were taken inside the house had lot of noise even at very low ISO levels with flash.Need to explore more as I have just got it. I am yet to take pictures in natural light.Would like to know from anybody out there who are having similar problems.My first thought is to return this camera.-----------------------April 11, 2009 Update:----------------------After using it for a month I would like to one thing for everybody who want's to buy this camera.PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS CAMERAYou cannot find a camera much worse than this in the market for 400$ ... Now it has come down to 350$...If you made up your mind I can not help, but for the last time I suggest you all to compare the snaps from P90 vs any Sony Cybershot/Canon on a computer screen and I am sure you will drop the idea of buying P90.
