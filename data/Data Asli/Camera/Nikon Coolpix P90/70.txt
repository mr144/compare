I have been shooting 35mm for over 20 years.I thought it was about time I try digital.D/SLR's are a bit pricey,so I wanted the best I could get for less.This is more than a 'point & shoot'.It's a megazoom bridge camera.A step above those credit card size digital cameras.But still below a SLR.I must have read over 200 reviews before I decided to buy it.Five star reviews out-numbered 1 star by 2 to 1.  There's two reasons people are getting poor photos with this camera. 1) They did not read the owners manual and the camera is set wrong.This is one of the few cameras that actually come with an owners manual you can hold in your hands.It's 175 pages long and takes time to soak in.I have had the camera for two weeks and I am still learning new things.You just can not take it out of the box and expect magazine quality shots.The other reason you may get poor results is you are expecting too much out of a $300 camera.It's not a D3X !  I have used the zoom hand held maxed out and got decent results.A little grain,but I was happy with them.And I am a very picky photographer! Shot some photos of a huge Christmas tree in a local mall, and they turned out great.  Poor photos are the result of a poor photographer, not the camera.  I ordered this from Amazon on a Saturday night and by Weds I had it in my hands !  If you are serious about getting into digital photography, this is a good start.If you just want to take snap shots, buy one of those pink Hello Kitty cameras.
