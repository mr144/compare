I am surprised that in a point and shoot camera you can have so many features. It impress me the smile recognition, (wow it`s magic ;-}). Most of the colors are great; sometimes in indoor they go a little yellow.The only con is the manual. The letters are small, for me=64yrs and they are gray. The zoom is powerful. Well, what else can I say?; I`m still learning new things.For a point and shoot I recommend it 100% !!!
