The price is ridiculous for this camera. My old $150 point and shoot was far better than this camera. The noise is absolutely horrible with this camera. You even get noise in your videos. Sure, it zooms a lot. But all that zooming reduces the quality SO much that it just turns out being a horrible photo. NOT recommended.Go buy $200 camera instead. For the same price, you can get a Canon SX10 which is better by far.
