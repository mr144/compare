I have a Canon Rebel XT SLR digital as my primary camera, but wanted something less expensive for every day use. I enjoy the P90, especially the zoom and the 3' LCD, but I advise you to buy at least one extra battery, as those features eat up the battery very quickly! I have used the video feature, and the quality is good.
