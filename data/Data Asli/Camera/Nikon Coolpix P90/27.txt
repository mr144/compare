I had never owned a Nikon before but I thought I would try this before moving on to a DSLR and boy was I disappointed. I bought the camera in January and since then it is gone back to Nikon for repair not once but twice for the same problem--the battery will not stay charged. I bought a new battery and new charger and that did not fix the problem. Nikon customer service was awful they said that they cannot get me a new camera until after they have had to repair it THREE times. The picture quality was worse than my small kodak that I carry in my purse and the flash would always get stuck. I am definitely not buying any Nikon products and was very disappointed in the way their so called customer service handled my complaints.
