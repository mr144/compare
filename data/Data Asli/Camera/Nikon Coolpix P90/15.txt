I have had this camera now for almost a year, and it is well worth it. The 24x optical zoom is a wonderful feature, and the picture quality from full wide to full zoom is great, and since I did not have to change lenses, I have not missed any shots. I have shot close up pics, which came out very clear and detailed even when using the auto setting. The monitor/electronic viewfinder option is a plus for bright sunny days. Built in flash works fine when needed. There are many other features, and settings that I have not even tried yet. When I do, I'll update my review. For an easy to use point and shoot camera that even my wife can use without asking me how to use it everytime and she has taken some great pictures with it, this is the one.
