I have always been a Nikon girl.  And when I was looking for a point and shoot with a telephoto capability. And the longest at that time was Canon SX10IS with (x20)power lens, I went for it.  It is a great camera.  I took it to the Grant Cayon and was so happy with it. Nikon then came out with a Coolpix P90 with a x24 lens.  It is Nikon's usual quality but is not as user friendly as the Canon.  So I usually use the Canon unless I need the X24 when taking nature pictures.
