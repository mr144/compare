Many of the things already stated (both good, bad, and in between) are there for your review. I wish I had waited longer to purchase this camera and had the insight of the earlier reviews.To the other reviewers' points, I waited months before sharing my opinion so that I tested it vigorously. I READ the instruction manual several times to improve my user experience which did help to a certain extent.In many ways it is a sound performer, but please know the limitations. The Nikon Coolpix P90 is excellent for outdoor photography, especially on sunny days. In fact, no better pictures have I taken on any other camera SLR, digital or film. That laid out, I have not been able to push the full zoom to its maximum capacity without blurry results. Disappointing.Indoor photography is a mixed bag, ISO levels in the 400-800 are pretty usable when used in close proximity to the subject, and a flash or adequate lighting is used. This camera is not so good with any extreme zooms or action shots. I guess that is to be expected with this class of camera. I was hoping for a little better performance here though.The macro function is not what I hoped for. It takes several manual adjustments to get a decent shot. The same goes for any experimentation with depth of field shots. Granted this is a 'point and shoot' classified camera in the $400 range, but I have had better luck with more basic point and shoots from Canon.Also, I find the video mode not too impressive either. Once you have set the focal length, it does not vary to allow proper zoom ins or outs.I really wanted to like this camera more than I do!So that is one person's opinion on this camera. I recently purchased a Canon PowerShot SX10IS to replace this unit. The jury is still out, but thus far this camera is far exceeding my expectations established with the Nikon Coolpix P90, and this Canon is now my prime camera.
