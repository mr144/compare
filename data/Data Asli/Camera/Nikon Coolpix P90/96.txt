This was my first digital camera and I bought it for the zoom.  This camera takes hight quality pictures and the comments never stop when people see the pictures.  The 12 MP makes the pictures very clear.  I have printed off many pictures of nature scenes for friends and family to hang on their walls as artwork.  The only drawback is the camera is bulky.  But for the quality of pictures after seeing people use cameras with the 12x zoon and 4 MP, I am very happy with my camera and it is bulkyness.  This camera has the best zoom you can get without having to change the lenses.  I read soem other comments where the design hurts your right hand with the curviture.  I have small hands but I also think the design is comfortable.
