this is first digital camera for me that is not a point and shoot...well it is, but its a little more advanced. Its a bit of a learning curve for me, and since I have had the camera less than a week, only 1 in 5 photos is really crisp, the others are at least way better than my old 5mp camera that i have had since 2005.I would recommend this camera for sure, just be prepared to spend some time with the manual and experimenting with the camera itself if you have never owned something more advanced than a standard point and shoot.so thats the brass tax, and without a big long review with a bunch of camera terms that i do not really know anyway. you will not be disappointed, but expect to be educated with it : )
