LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this camera.  I have had an Olympus Stylus 730 for several years and love it, but I wanted an upgrade although not yet ready for a SLR.  This camera fit my needs perfectly.  I wanted the full control manual settings to get me ready for the SLR, but was not ready for the cost because I am still learning about photography.  This camera is definitely a great deal at right around $300.  The 24x optical zoom is awesome.  I was used to 3x, which is awful for distant landscape shots.  I love the tilt screen display, this is a very functional feature.  I was also looking for a digital camera with a viewfinder; although this model's viewfinder is the digital display it serves it is purpose.  The continuous shot mode is great; shooting at around 12 frames per second...this makes getting that perfect shot during a sporting event or dance recital very easy.The camera has a great weight to it and is very comfortable to hold. I love that it has a flash release button so if you do not intend on using the flash you just do not open it.  The menu is easy to use.  Battery life seems to be around 4 hours and only takes about 2 to fully charge.  The camera comes with a lens cap and a neck strap, usb cable, tv cable, battery charger and battery.  I purchased a spare battery and recommend you search for a true Nikon EL-EN5 battery...I got mine for under $20.  The mfg recommends only using their brand, I concur.  From past experience I have seen off brand batteries mess the ports up so the camera becomes unusable.All in all if you are looking for a point and shoot with a lot of the manual capabilities of a SLR camera this is a good choice.
