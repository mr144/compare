well i thought before i got it that it would never do what i wanted. i wanted to take pictures of birds, then enlarge them so i could identify them in my book. i am a beginning bird watcher. Well i was wrong....i can take the picture and then enlarge them again..and crop, change the lighting. i am very pleased with the camera...If a 56 yr. old woman can create great photos....any one can!!!
