Disclaimer first: I am an amateur with a camera, not a pro. Having said that: Awesome camera for the price. Great features. Picture quality is pretty good. I got it mostly for the speed shooting so that I could take pictures of my daughter playing volleyball (and her team, too, I guess.) You have to really experiment with the setting some to get it just right, but it works really well! Do not settle for just the presets already programed in.I looked at a lot of cameras before settling on this one. I am sure you can find a better camera, but probably at a much higher price.The battery comes with a charger, and you can always buy a spare. It will take about 120-150 normal photos on a charge. It will actually take about 1500 + on a charge using sports mode, but that's probably because it just zipping away, and you take 20-30 photos in the same amount of time you take just one under normal circumstances.Get a camera bag and tripod with grippy legs. They both come in handy!
