I replaced an old sony Mavica cd camera with the Nikon P90.  A vast improvement in all ways but one.  I am not familliar with the zoom on this camera yet and it zooms very quickly so I end up zooming back and forth a lot to get the picture size I want.  I think it will be fine after some more use.  Also the button for the zoom seems backward to me.  Another thing that some use will take care of.  I really like the fact that you can just take the SD card out and download it.  I also purchased the Transcend SDHC card that came with an adaptor to plug right into the USB on my computer.  NICE AND EASY to get the pictures onto my hard drive.The pictures turn out great in the Auto mode and the anti-vibration system seems to do it is job well.  Overall, a great camera for the money.
