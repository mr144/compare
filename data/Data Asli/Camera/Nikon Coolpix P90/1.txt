Bought the Nikon Coolpix P90 12.1MP from Amazon.com (good price $429).  Only used it for trips (less than 5 times).  On the 2nd trip using the camera, I were not able to turn the P90 on (dead), so the entire trip was a loss (no pictures).  Sent in for repair (paid $160) and took it for trip to Galapagos.  Again, halfway on the trip, could not turn on the camera (dead).  Called Nikon and they said I have to pay another $160 in order to have them check the camera for the same problem since I did not contact them within the 6 months warranty for the repair.  Liked the light weight (main reason to buy the P90).  When shooting facing sun, there was a bright vertical line in the middle of the focusing object, not sure if this is defect for my P90 or it is defect on all the P90 design.  Decided not to pay another $160 to fix the camera and will not buy Nikon again.  I will switch back to Canon, which I used to own one (very good pictures and reliable).
