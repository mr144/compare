The body design of this camera is a big minus.  I have been using digital cameras of almost all major brands such as Sony, Canon, Pentax and Minolta.  My recent purchase of Nikon P90 has brought in mixed reaction on me.  I am really happy with the quality of pics (12.1 mp) this camera produces with its awsome 15X optical zoom.  During my recent visit to SFO, I could get a crystal clear view of the Alcatraz from pier 39 ground.  The minus aspects are (1) the holding comfort is too bad. The right hand curvature is too sharp making your fingers literally getting squeezed too much (acute angle) (2) the internal mechanism does not seem to be robust and rigid.  We can feel parts moving when you slightly shake the camera.  This is something i have never faced in either Sony or Canon or Pentax or Minolta.  I am 50/50 for this gadget.  Anyways Nikon is not a great brand when it comes to aesthetics. This camera is the worst.
