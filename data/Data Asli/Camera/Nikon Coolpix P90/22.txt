I was in need of a new camera, but did not want just a point and shoot, but I wasnt quiet ready for a DSLR either. So when the P90 came out I was super excited. Being stationed in Guam with so many beautiful scenary Im in picture taking heaven!! The camera is definetely getting used and I couldnt be more happy.I would recommend it to anybody who is hesitant about getting a DSLR but still wants awesome shots.The only thing somewhat negative I have to say is it does not take as good of indoor shots as it does outdoor. Still love it.
