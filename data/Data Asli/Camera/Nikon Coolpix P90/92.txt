When I first saw this camera, I was like 'Wow! A Nikon with 24x optical zoom, manual settings if I want them, and 12 megapixels. How could I go wrong?' But when I got the camera and started taking pictures, I saw how bad the image quality was. Almost every single shot was blurry, had poor color, and was either saturated or discolored. My 8 year old 3 Megapixel Sony Cybershot takes better pictures than this piece of junk! I notice there are 2 kinds of reviews for this product - those who love it and those who hate it. The people who love it must be fooling their brain into thinking they like the thing so they can sleep at night. This thing is a POS. I have returned it and I plan to buy a Cannon.
