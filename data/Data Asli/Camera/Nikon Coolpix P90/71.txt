I can not give you a long detailed explanation about why I love this camera.  I have no experience with high dollar cameras.  I only know point and shoot cameras.I can tell you this camera is solid, is fairly easy to use, has tons of great features, and takes some fantastic pictures with little effort on my part.  I started out by taking all kinds of different pictures aruond my house and property, just to experiment.  It's easy to delete the ones you do not want to keep anyway, so I recommend doing some experimentation before you get serious with it.
