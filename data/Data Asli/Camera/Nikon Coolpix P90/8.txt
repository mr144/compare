This is the very best camerai have ever owned. No need for gadgets. So many options built in. Love the view finder.use it more than screen. I guess that is from my SLR days. I thought the tilt screen would come in handy, but hardly use it.  One other thing, unlike so many things, the owners manual is easy to understand. This is very important.
