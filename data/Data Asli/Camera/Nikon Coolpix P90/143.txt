Well, I bought this camera to take on vacation along with the wonderful D80 that I already have, but I am thinking of letting the D80 stay home and just taking this camera with a point and shoot Canon that I use for  everyday. The far edge of the zoom with the digital zoom engaged--had severe red chromatic abberation, but since it is so bad, I can easily isolate the red and change the color in Photoshop.  In other words, what would be a major criticism is really no problem because the resolution is fantastic, even hand-held at the far, far, edge of the 24 optical zoom (which does not have the abberation because it has only ocurred when I engaged the digital zoom). Nikon has traditionally been a couple of steps behind Canon and Sony in the compact big zoom cameras, but this P90 zoomed way ahead--and the best part is that it is Nikon glass! Terrific!! This camera is the worst. This camera is the worst. This camera is the worst.
