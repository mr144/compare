I saw this camera for the first time in a store in Egypt , I was planning to buy a new camera and when i saw this one it attracted me but ... The price of this camera were a bit expensive , When i saw it here in amazon i found out that it is about 1000 LE cheaper than Egypt and that is why i decided to buy it and i actually did and i do not regret it :) It is a very nice camera indeed , A great LCD and a great lens and a very sharp images with a great options available in this camera , For &#1616;amateur photographers .. I recommend this awesome camera.
