I have had a couple of bridge cameras now and this one is by far the best. I actually prefer this to a DSLR. It beats out my wifes $1000 dslr. It does everything Sony says it does very well, and somethings Sony does not say. I found a place online to get a 58mm adapter ring so that you can put a filter/lens on (you can look it up on youtube just put in the info for this camera and add adapter)  The  a lot of the features negate the need for a filter but proper use of the filters will make your images look even better. This camera unlike other point and shoots also gives you the ability to manually adjust the settings for the photos you want.  Many of my friends have dslr's and when they see the quality of the shots i get AND find out how much i paid for this they look like they are going to through up on me...
