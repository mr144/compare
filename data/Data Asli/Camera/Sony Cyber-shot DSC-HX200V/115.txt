For a point & shoot camera this very fast and the long zoom works great for birding and wildlife.I do not have anything bad to say about the camera.I carry the pont& shoot and the sony a55 with me when ever I get to go to a wildlife area ,for long shots I use the sony 200 and fast pics I use the A55 which get 10 frames per second. I am happy with both.
