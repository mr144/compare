After years of using Nikon SLR cameras I was ready to change to a smaller camera with more uses (movies, panoramas, etc.)  I did not want to carry a separate camera bag full of lenses, etc. anymore. However, I do a lot of photography and I did not want to sacrifice quality.  I admired the beautiful images a friend was getting with the Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V, so I ordered one.The resolution is amazing and it takes great exposures in low light and mixed lighting conditions.  The zoom covers the equivalent of the focal length of most separate lenses for SLRs with ease and better results.  I am still learning all this camera will do, but it is easy to use from the start.  The incamera guide is great and makes it easy to use all the features.  I would definitely recommend this camera.
