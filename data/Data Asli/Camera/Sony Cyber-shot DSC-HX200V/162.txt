Comparing this camera to its smaller sibling the HX20V which has the same sensor but lacks a viewfinder, this big brother is supposed to be better right? This is why it is much more expensive. The fact is that it is only mildly better. I was very disappointed to discover they did not included a faster processor to reduce the annoying lag between each picture taken. We are talking about waiting anywhere between two to three seconds before you can take another photo. That is an eternity for any camera let alone a camera in this price range.The quality of the viewfinder is just mediocre, when the camera detects your eye it take a whooping two seconds to switch from LCD to viewfinder mode, that is an eternity when you are shooting fast action.On one hand this camera offers an easy way to shoot with a 30x zoom but if you are a pro I doubt you will be happy with the resulting noisy images. I tested the camera at noon in a snowy landscape and the noise was unacceptable compared to any other camera.There is one major design flaw. the power button is not recessed enough so the camera keeps turning itself on inside the bag hence extending the telephoto lens and getting jammed, this will most certainly damage the camera after a short while.
