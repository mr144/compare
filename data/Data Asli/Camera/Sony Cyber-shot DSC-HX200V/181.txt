I have had several digital cameras, but this one by far is the best of all of the cameras I have had.  I originally purchased this camera because I was taking a trip out to San Francisco to see a friend of mine and do a little travelling around in the SF Bay area and knew that I was going to be taking a boat trip across the bay to get a better glimpse of Alcatraz.  I knew that I would not be able to get real close to it, so I wanted a camera that had great picture quality and an excellent zoom capability.  I chose this camera because I am a novice when it comes to photography, and did not want to purchase a several thousand dollar camera with hundreds or thousands of dollars in several lenses... I am extremely happy with this camera.  It is a &#34;smart&#34; camera and makes my photos look like a professional took them !
