I bought this camera to take advantage of its GPS system.  It does that great!  It takes great pictures.  It is easy to use.  It's zoom allowed me to see into the bird's nests on the cliff sides while we sailed Resurrection Bay (Seward, Alaska), as well as zoomed in on the spout of the orca whales. I put my picutres on Picasa and I can always key into the location of the pictures, and this also worked on our trip to Germany, Paris and Rome. Amazingly wonderful as the years go by and I need a memory help as to where we took which picture.The one thing that I do not like about the camera is that is is a &#34;mini&#34; computer (my description), so when you take a picture it is not a shutter clicking quickly but a computer saving the picture.  So it is slow.  Even though you can set it to take 10 pictures as you hold the button down, after taking one picture or up to 10, you have to wait, wait, wait until you can take the next picture.  With old cameras, the shutter clicks and you are ready for the next shot, click, click, click.  I spent too much on this camera to let it go, but I sure would like to have a solution to its slowness.Some of the pictures we took are fantastic!  Worth everything!  Print out beautifully on the computer or the photo store.  For the excellent picutres, I am grateful to this camera.
