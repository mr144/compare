I love photography but i never had a camera of my own..i decided to get one and my initial preferences were cannon and nikon..I went to best buy to check out the cameras ..tried a few cannons and nikon's. The ones which i liked were way too expensive and those which were in my budget were not up to my expectations..then i happened to stop by the Sony DSC- HX200V. when i checked it out i told myself this is the camera i am gonna get. Clarity , quick focus and magnificent zoom were buttering me to get it as soon as possible.I decided to get it but then i thought of just comparing the price with amazon and i was glad to know that amazon is selling it at 70$ less then best buy..i ordered it the same day and i received it in just 2 days..i have been using it since last one month and i m in love with it..I am more than happy to have Sony DSC- HX200V as my first camera..
