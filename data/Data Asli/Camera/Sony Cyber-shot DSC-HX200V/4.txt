I am impressed with the easy of use and the great capabilities of this camera. The automatic settings are good enough to get very good pictures and video in almost any light condition, distance from subject, etc. This camera allows you to shoot video and perform zoom in and out at the same time, so it works pretty well as a video camera too, besides the image quality is really great.I had a Canon camera which suddenly died for no reason, and exactly the same happened to one of my friends recently. Personally I do not like the images from Canon cameras very much, I really prefer the colors and durability of SONY.
