easy to use, very low cost picture processing, good price.  It comes with small amount of memory only good for about 17 pics.  Plan early to get a level 4- 16 gig for about $12 san disk card.  Lens cap pops off if you forget and turn it on.  No haze filter included.  Many extra shoot scenes, pan, close up, faces, kids, animals, etc.  I like the low light capability, do not even have to use flash for many evening scenes. I can recommend it highly.  Note the v stands for GPS which can be added to memory record for each shot.
