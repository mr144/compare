It has been very frustrating to try to learn how to use this camera.  The Instruction Manual and the InCamera Guide are jokes.  The supplied lens cap (not addressed in the mentioned documentation) inteferes with lens extension when camera is turned on.  The In-Camera Guide and the wastebasket function are accessed by the same button (this appears to be because it makes it easy to delete the In-Cama Guide).
