I have tested out the Panasonic 150, canon sx40, and now this one... I went back to this one because of its quality and features. I have a Nikon dslr for when I need an excellent camera, but I wanted a good zoom that I could not afford. The Panasonic was an awesome camera too, but I just loved the extras of this one and the great camera affects this offers. I just love the HDR paintings ! The video is also great with this camera. You will not regret this one. I am having a great time playing with all the effects the Panasonic does not have. I was also worried as all the panasonics seems to get dust in the lens. Two of my last ones did, and it ruined the pics I took.
