The LCD would not light up to levels expected. I called Sony and they attempted to correct it over the phone. They were unable to and suggested I try their web site, sony.com/repair.Battery charger and battery for HX200V was received from DM.Charger was incorrect and under capacity.The results of Sony's suggestion to go to their repair site was also unfruitful.It listed where I might find commercial repair companies. What happenned to my garantee? The camera is only a week old.m My experience with Amazon and their third party placement orders has been a nightmare. There is a lot to be said for shopping locally.ALG
