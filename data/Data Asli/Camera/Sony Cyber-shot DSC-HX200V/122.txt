I love this camera.  Went to the Miami zoo for its first expedition out and it gets in so close to the animals, I zeroed in on a small portion of an elephant's face.  I was told that the photos I took with it look like they came from a Nat Geo magazine.  It's the most lightweight camera I could find with the best zoom.
