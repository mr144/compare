I was not familiar with the Sony camera, but I loved the fact that it had an optical viewfinder as well as a LCD display.  Once I started to find out what it could do I just fell in love with it.  If you want to use the optical viewefinder it automatically switches by placing your eye up to the viewer.  The picture quality is outstanding. The zoom strength is superb. The price was very reasonable and the delivery time was fanastic. I would recommend this camera to family, friends and fellow travelers.
