I bought this camera to replace my Sony DSC-H7 which I used with a x3 converter to photograph birds. The results were excellent as it enabled me to capture pictures that would have been impossible with a DSLR.The DSC-HX200V is an impressive improvement over my previous camera. The 18.2 MP does occasionally create impressionistic pictures when photographing small birds at full zoom and printing an 8 x 10 or larger. Locating birds in flight with the view finder requires lots of practise because the automatic zoom is so fast.Super automatic mode creates impressive vivid naturalistic photos. This camera is an impressive improvement over the previous generation with some limitations but it captures photos that would have been impossible only a few years ago.Addendum: When enlarging bird photos to 8x10 & 13x19 I found the image degraded.By accessing the shooting menu and selecting Image Size I reduced the mega pixels to 10 and drastically improved my larger images.
