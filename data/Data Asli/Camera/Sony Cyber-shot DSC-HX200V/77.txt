Up to this point we have always purchased cheap ($100) point and shoot cameras. They would work for a year or so and then we were off to go buy another. After our last digital started acting up we decided that we were going invest in a good digital camera. We went back and forth about getting a higher end point and shoot or getting a SLR. We are not professional photographers and did not feel that we wanted to spend the extra money and time on a digital SLR. So we decided on the Sony DSC-HX200V. I am so glad we chose this camera! We took it with us to our daughters dance competition and man did it exceed my expectations. One of the features I used the most was the burst mode. You can set it for various amounts of pictures to take during a burst. Very clear, precise pictures. The special effects (black and white, adding different colors or shades to the picture) was a big bonus. The video camera portion is HD, very good quality and you can take pictures while you are recording. The zoom on this unit is phenomenal, I was taking pictures from the back of the auditorium like I was sitting in the front row! We have had it about 2 months now and have taken about 1,000 pictures and we are still learning about more features. I would recommend this camera to anyone and would buy it again in a heart beat.
