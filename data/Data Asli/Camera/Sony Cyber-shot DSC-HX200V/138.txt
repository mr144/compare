This camera is amazing. The Exmor sensor is the best system ever when light is a problem. The zoom and stabilization are the best partner because no matter if you want to use full zoom this camera always take pictures without blur. Great focus. The only bad is that I would have liked this camera had a compatible system to change lenses, but it is not.
