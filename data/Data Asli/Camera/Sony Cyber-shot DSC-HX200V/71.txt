This is certainly not a DSLR but is one of the best point and shoots on the market. I purchased it over the Canon SX50 due to the price. I absolutely love my Sony. The stabilization works great, the superior-intelligence mode selects the best settings about 95% of the time. The HD video is superior! Sound quality is good as well. The zoom is outstanding and the images usually turn out stellar with very little effort. For anyone who wants more than a cheap point and shoot, this camera would be considered a great one for someone who does not want a DSLR.My only complaint is it sometimes seems longer than what I am used to for saving images in certain modes.Overall, this camera is stellar. I recommended it to friends already.
