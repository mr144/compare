Since I was unable to attend my sister's college graduation I decided to send her this camera as a gift. She loved it. Unfortunately I did not receive the package as I shipped it directly to her. However, she did say that it arrived a day early, the packaging was nice and tight, and all contents were included. She is in love with her camera.
