You can do SO much with this camera. I needed to update, and shopped for a long time to get the right fit for us and my business. The best part about this is that the manual is on the camera, so if you need help it is only a few buttons away. It's not as light as something slim that would slip into a purse (or pocket) but it is not as heavy and bulky as something 100% professional either. It's a really great camera for the price.
