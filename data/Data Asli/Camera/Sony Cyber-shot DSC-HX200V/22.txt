Bought the wife a couple different models, including the $700 Cannon ones and she continually complained about them. Since I bought her this one she has not said a bad word. She loves everything about this camera. This is a perfect camera for someone who loves to take thousands of pictures a month (yes Im not kidding). Bought an accessory pack for everything in the world she could have wanted and its been perfect.
