I spent a lot of time reading reviews and comparing cameras in this range.I found myself not wanting to invest in a DSLR, but I love photography and film and knew I would enjoy using something more complex than a normal point-and-shoot.This &#34;bridge&#34; camera is perfect for my situation, and anyone else thinking the same.The wide lens and super zoom is outstanding! The body feels sturdy and has a rubber grip like a dslr. The video quality is excellent and the options for photography are great!There are so many customizable features on this camera that will keep you entertained, but not confused.In summary, if you are looking for a quality camera in between a dslr and a point and shoot, THIS IS IT! Stop looking, you'll be pleased with this! It's mid-range price for a bridge camera feels great for your wallet too!
