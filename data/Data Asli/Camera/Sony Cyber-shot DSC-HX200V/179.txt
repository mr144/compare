I own an older model Sony HX-1 camera, and have been very pleased with it. I purchased the HX200V for the added zoom capabilities, and the many additional features not offerd by the HX1. Since the HX200V is in the same line of cameras, and a newer model, I naturally expected improvements in most areas. If not, why produce a newer model?My main interest with any camera is Image Quality (IQ). If the pictures are not sharp, so what if it has all sorts of bells and whistles.DO NOT expect sharp images from the Sony HX200V! All images at all focal lengths are soft with no definition. To add to the problems, at extended zoom ranges there is noticeable purple fringing in areas of high contrastDo not expect help from Sony support. They are in the Phillipines, and besides the language barrier, the individual you will talk to is trying to be proficient on every Sony electronics product, and consequently knows very little about any of them, including the HX200V.I own a number of Sony products and have been pleased with most. My experience with this camera will probably make this my last Sony purchase.
