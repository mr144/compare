I tried the Fuji HS30EXR and Canon P510.  Did not like them so I returned them in the first week and bought this Sony.  I love the way the smooth auto focus and zoom works.  Took about 100 photos in the first week and do not have any negative remarks yet.  This is a keeper.I am replacing my old Olympus 12.1 20x camera.
