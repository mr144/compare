I purchased this camera after using a Nikon for a number of years.  While I loved the Nikon for many things, my kiddos have entered into tennis and music and capturing those moments was becoming more and more challenging.  Enter this Sony camera.  Out of the box I was taking great pictures.  I have great action shots from tennis, wonderful video from concerts and school performances, and some wonderful night time shots from a storm last night.  I have not even scratched the surface with the settings... and I cannot wait!  Note:  I am not an avid photographer, but I appreciate wonderful pictures.  So, if you are not searching for a camera that requires a class, but need more zoom than a typical point and shoot, want nice video, great portraits, and some flexibility with settings, this one is for you!
