This is my first &#34;real&#34; camera and wanted something high quality enough to take great photos without having to worry about changing lenses.... It is so easy to just point and shoot and every photo turns out perfect! The zoom works amazing and the picture still turns out clear. Love the adjustable screen and the electronic view finder. I would highly suggest this to anyone who wants GREAT pictures and does not mind carrying around a &#34;bigger&#34; camera
