I owned Sony cameras before and two years ago decided to buy a Nikon for my purse for easy access to a camera. It was ok, but I missed the zoom on my old Sony. I started looking at a new camera about six months ago and really researched the zoom and other options. I wanted a great camera without carrying a large bag with me and spending a lot of time setting up and missing the moment. I chose this camera because of the zoom, previous satisfaction with Sony and the price. I was so surprised and Sony made me get back to picture taking. I am not a professional photographer, I am a mom who has kids that play sports and I need zoom. This camera is awesome and I learned it very quickly. Did I say the zoom is great? The zoom is great and the colors awesome! My camera came quickly and safely.
