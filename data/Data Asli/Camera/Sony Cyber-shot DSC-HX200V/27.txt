This is an excellent camera that will give great results for the point and shoot user, and even better results for those willing to spend the time to lear how to use some of its advanced features.  The image quality and low-light abilities are stunning, and the 30x zoom is awsome.  I have put my Nikon Coolpix P90 away in the camera closet.  It can not touch the low-light capability or ease of use of the Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V.
