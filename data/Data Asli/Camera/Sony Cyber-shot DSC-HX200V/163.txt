This camera is VERY easy to learn and use. It takes fantastic pictures (my favorite setting is the background highlight). The biggest problem all my previous cameras have had was that it would darken the picture and not catch the natural light. With this camera my husband set it to background highlight (without flash) when only the christmas tree lights were on and the picture came out clear and bright! I love this camera and would definitely recommend it to anyone. It is well worth the extra money!!!
