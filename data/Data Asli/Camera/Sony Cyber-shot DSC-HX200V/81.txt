I bought this to replace a Canon IS 3 that I have had for 4 or 5 years. So far the Sony has performed wonderfully. The optical zoom and clear shot zoom works great. I would highly recommend this camera. I was really satisfied with the two Canon cameras that I have had and with the Sony Cybershot before them but this camera blows them away. For the cost this just fits the bill for me. I have been able to take great pictures of the deer and turkeys that come to visit us here in our back yard and the picyures of the grandchildern have come out great. The low light pictures are great also. I have owned this camera forabout two months and I have taken a lot of photos with it. I have tried to take pictures in most of the modes. You have to experiment with it to see what you can do with it and find what features you like and what they can do. I did get some blurring taking some inside shots at my grandsons wrestling meet with the flash off and using intelligent auto but with the flash on they came out great. The HD movies in my opinion are awesome. All in all it has been money well spent.
