I bought this primarily for the zoom and I had liked Sony camera in the past.  I recently used this on a trip and it delivered in all ways but one.  Its panorama feature is too automated.  You sweep the camera and it does the rest, however if you are like me and want more control, or want to access the individual shots to make the panorama on a PC, then you are out of luck.  The zoom is great as well as the image stabilization, and even the over zoom is useable.  If you look at the individual pixels you'll see a bunch of noise and noise reduction artifacts, however in practice if you shoot at the maximum resolution and reduce the image for printing or albums, most of that noise fades away.  Think of it like scanning a newspaper or magazine picture at high res.  You'll see all the dots, however if you shrink it by 50%, the dot screening goes away.  Anyway, great camera.  Its too bad it seems this year's model lacks the GPS but does give you a bigger zoom.
