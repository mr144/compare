I am not by any means a camera expert, you can find plenty of 'pros' reviews below mine I am sure, but being just an average person I love using this camera. It's easy to use although at first all the features can be a little overwhelming. I have had other Sony cameras in the past so a lot of the features were similar to my older model cyber shot which was a huge plus for me. You do not need to be a camera expert to really get a great shot, just put the camera in 'i+' mode and shoot, easy as that, the camera really does all the work. If you are looking for a good beginner digital SLR camera for a reasonable price you have found it. My only gripe is that sometimes when you use auto focus the image on the view finder will look blurry, but when you actually take the picture it is crystal clear.
