It's simple, fast and takes great pictures.It may seem expensive but, it is worth it.  Do not have the hassle of changing lenses due to the great lens for wide angle and zoom.My fianc&eacute; has an older model and I received the latest model and the video button is great.Thanks to Sony for keeping things simple, intuitive, creative and high quality.I would recommend this camera to anyone.  It makes grabbing and going to take pictures much more fun.
