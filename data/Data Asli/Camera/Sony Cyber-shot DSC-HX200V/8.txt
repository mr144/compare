I have used a Canon DSLR for several years and the weight of the camera/lens began to cause pain in my hands and wrists.  Based on other reviews I purchased the Sony.  It is so much more lightweight, but you have the feel of holding a larger camera.  I needed lens stability and have had no issues with blurry pictures (except for fast moving grandkids).  I am still trying to get familiar with all the multiple settings, but overall I really like this camera.
