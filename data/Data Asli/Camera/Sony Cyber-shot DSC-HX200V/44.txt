I bought this camera a few weeks ago and it is great! I love that I can capture close-ups of my son in his school play from the back row in the auditorium with this camera. It takes movies and pictures and you can capture a pic during the movie without interrupting the movie clip. The 30X optical zoom and picture quality make it so worth the money. It has so many cool features that I have not had the chance to try yet. I have also taken nice photos that I can display on my living rooms walls, and I think they look professional. No more portrait studio sessions and sitting fees---I can get the pictures of my family that I want on this camera.
