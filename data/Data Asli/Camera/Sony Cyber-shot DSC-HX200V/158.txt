I received this camera for Christmas (early) and have used it for family photos and such.  It takes very clear photos and the shaking is minimal when using the zoom.  I have recorded several videos and was impressed by the sound quality and the ease of transferring to a large TV.  Overall, I am enjoying the camera and its ease of use.The only con I have so far is that the camera will freeze periodically.  It does not happen alot and does not affect my photo saving capabilities, but is rather annoying.  It will start by saying the camera cannot read the memory card and to reinsert it.  I do that and then it will freeze.  I will take out the battery and put it back in.  This fixes the issue and I am good to go.  This is the reason for the 3 stars.  This is a big feature that should work appropriately.  I might have given it 4 stars, but this camera is not listed in Lightroom 4 for sync purposes.  Which is more of an issue for Lightroom, but Sony really should work with Adobe to make sure all their cameras work their software since it is the most popular out there.Overall, the camera is good for the price.  You can have added control to customize your shots, while keeping the ease of a point and shoot.  If you are not ready for a DSLR quite yet, but what a little more control than a typical point and shoot, this is for you.  Plus, the HD recording is fantastic and puts to pieces of equipment into one.  Hope this helps!
