I was saddened when my old Sony quit working properly, and it would have cost too much to repair, but when I saw this one on Amazon, I perked up. 30 x zoom! Wow! I am a nature photographer, taking most photos of birds in my back yard. The 30x zoom brings them up close and personal and I have already had some 8 x 10s made, framed and now displayed on my family room wall. The LCD screen pulls out and tilts in many angles - a definite plus, as some shots I take are of birds on tree branches. Also there is an aperture adjustment wheel very handy to the finger tip to darken or lighten the exposure. All my digital cameras have been Sonys, and I do think they are top notch.
