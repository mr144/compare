I love being able to take zoom photos and this camera can do a combined 120 hand-held. We are living on the ocean in Maui and I can get great, sharp shots even using full zoom. I am going to invest in a tripod because I do have trouble holding the camera as steady as I did like on full zoom.  The steady-shot is great for sharpness.  This is my 6th Sony camera.  I currently have 2.  When a new better zoom comes out I am on it.  I do not like having to change lenses but want great pic results so I stick with Sony.
