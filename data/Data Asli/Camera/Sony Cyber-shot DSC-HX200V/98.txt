For what I paid Amazon for this camera, I am pretty certain that it can not be beat. I have not bought a new camera in a long, long time, when I saw what this camera could do on Youtube, and saw it was a Sony, I was sold. I have had this for about a month now, and have taken pictures every day, I have not been disapointed at all. Remember, I said it is fantastic &#34;for the price I paid&#34;, I am sure you could pay more and get more.
