I was astonished at the quality of this Sony &#34;point and shoot&#34;.  First of all, the battery life is far better than previous models.  Secondly, the camera flawlessly perfoms the functions of many SLR type cameras, and with ease.  I found resolution to be very good.  The zoon is quick and smooth.  High res movies also, with zoom controls enabled, and decent sound.What I did not like was the rather poor instructions for the camera, and the fact that trying to shoot a back lit subject required shifting out of &#34;i&#34; mode into &#34;P&#34; (program) mode in order to force the flash to fire as fill flash.Overall, however, I found this camera to be the best point and shoot that I have ever handled, and compliment Sony on coming out with a very good product.Be aware, however, that you will likely need a class 10 SDHC stick to use this critter, and that stick does not come with the camera.
