Love this!  I bought this for myself for Christmas, and I really love this.  Makes awesome pictures and is easy to use.  Highly recommend!The only draw-back is that it is a BIG camera.  My old camera would easily slip into my pocket or purse, and this one is not quite that easy.  So, what I do with this camera is just hang it around my neck.
