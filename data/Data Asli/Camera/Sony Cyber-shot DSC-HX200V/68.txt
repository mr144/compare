I got this a a replacement for my beloved Epson PC850, which finally gave up the ghost after 15? 20? years. So far I am real impressed with its features and ease of use, though I have not tried everything out  yet. I mostly shoot on automatic, but I like having the manual options available when I want them. It does a great job on close-up shots, which I do a lot of in my job as a museum registrar, but I think it'll be great for portraits and landscapes, too. Have not played with the movie function much, but it seems to do a good job compensating for unsteady hands.
