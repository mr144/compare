I got this mid October 2012.The main reasons for getting this camera were the outstanding zoom (just watch on YouTube the moon zoom test), the minimal shutter lag, the quick start up and the very fast auto-focus - crucial for point and shoot. So far I have not been able to explore all the features as there are so many of them.So far, the only improvement I would suggest to Sony: do not start the lens zoom engine if the camera detects the lens cap is still on. Currently the on/off button is very sensitive and it is very easy to accidentally turn the camera on when the lens cap is still on. The lens protrudes and the cap string puts pressure on the lens motor. I suggest buyers replace the existing string by an elastic one.
