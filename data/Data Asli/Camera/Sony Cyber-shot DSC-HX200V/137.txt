After lots of research and testing of other cameras with similar features I choose the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V.  I have a quality pocket camera, but wanted something with more zoom, better quality movies, and a few creative features.  I have not been disappointed with this Bridge Camera.  First, I love the 30x zoom.  It was the best at focusing at full zoom (handheld) and getting a great shot.  The HD movies are impressive and I was very happy with the low light pictures I have taken inside and outside.  Each camera tested had unique features that I liked, however, overall this Sony won out.  Out of the box using the Auto settings you can take quality photos and movies so its pretty user friendly in that way.  It's been fun learning to use all thats available on this feature packed camera.
