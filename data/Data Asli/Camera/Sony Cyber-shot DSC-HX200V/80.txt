This is an excellent camera for the serious photographer - it is a cross over camera - half way between a Point & Shoot and full blown Digital camera with all the toys.  The perforamce is outstanding and will nevewr let you down.  I have won many photo contests with this camera - excellent product - excellent price - excellent quality
