I have had this for a month now, love the video feature, also tried a few of the preset features in picture mode , love the results and as always pictures in bright areas are excellent. can actually use the long zoom with  the built in stabilizer in hand held mode. does a lot of corrections to make up for hand shake and bad lighting. fast zoom, excellent point and shoot if u do not care for the smallest form factor, battery life is decent, needs an after market external battery charger cause the included charger requires in camera charging .
