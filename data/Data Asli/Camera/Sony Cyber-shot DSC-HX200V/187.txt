I think bridge camera is a good description. I was looking for a step up from my point and shoot . This camera seems to fill the bill for me .  I like the fact that I can get good zoom shots and not have to carry extra lens. It seems to have plenty of adjustable settings. I have had about a month so still learning all the features. Did get some low light pics of the moon. You can see the craters on the moon. Fun camera.
