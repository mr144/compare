I needed an affordable 1080/60p camera for a project this summer, so I went with this one. I really thought it would be a well weighted sturdy camera, but not really. It was a little light and a little hallow where you hold the camera. The camera lens is actually where all the weight is. Also, the zooming in/out is a little slow, it does not go as quickly as other cameras.  But despite that, its a very good camera. Beautiful photos and great quality video mode.
