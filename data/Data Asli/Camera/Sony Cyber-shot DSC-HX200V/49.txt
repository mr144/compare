The camera takes good pictures. I am not professional by any means which I believe makes this camera a perfect match for me. The zoom is amazing! took a sample picture of a village about 3/4 to 1 mile away and with full zoom at sunrise I can clearly see the details of the wall of a hut. No blur with intelligent auto+. Others have complained about the lens cover getting stuck and hindering the camera. Either sony redesigned the lens cover or maybe its my setup because I have forgotten to take it off a few times so far and everytime the cover came off on its own no harm or hinderance to the operation of this camera. I have the lanyard for the cover tied to the left side of the camera when viewing from the rear of the camera and I always place the cover on so that when looking at the front you can read the words on the cover. Maybe this is the key and maybe I have a different cover. Overall i did definitely recommend it to others with the same needs as me. Not quite professional quality but well above average point and shoot cameras.
