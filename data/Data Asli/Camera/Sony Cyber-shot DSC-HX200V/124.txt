The instructions would have been nice in a booklet like you used to get instead of having to go online. Other than that it is very easy to hold and the quality of the pictures is truly great. As I am learning more about it I am happy I chose this camera. Overall, this camera is better than lumix, Canon, kodak, pentak, fujifilm, GE or coolpix.
