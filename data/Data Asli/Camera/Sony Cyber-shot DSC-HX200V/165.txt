I absolutely LOVE this camera, I just got this today from Best Buy and paid over $500 for it. It's amazing.  I love the manual zoom (optional setting). It's just amazing, takings great photos. It's my first good camera, and I love it. Deff. going to hang onto this for awhile. I am fascinated with it, and spent hours just taking silly pictures of my cat playing with the settings. It's a great camera, plenty of scenes and settings. Flash is bright. It's good. I really recommend this camera. It's amazing.
