This is not an SLR camera.  It is also not a pocket-sized camera.  It was not meant to be either one, so saying that it can not change lenses or that it is big and clunky is not fair.  This camera is meant to give high-quality images with several bells and whistles without breaking the bank.  It does those things very well.  There are already several fabulous reviews here, so I will not go into lots of detail about everything--I'll just share highlights and my favorite features* The video quality is outstanding.  All other cameras we have purchased in the past are SD and while I have never had a problem with them, the videos from this camera are much clearer, bigger, and better.  Note that the file size is also much larger, as would be expected.* The zoom range is fabulous!  My SLR can zoom as much, but it would take 2 separate lenses.* The built in stabilization feature seems to work very well, esp when zoomed way in.* The tilt-down feature on the LCD view finder is much more useful than I had originally thought and allows me to take pictures from angles that I normally could not do.* The UI is easy and intuitive.Other notes:* The various auto-modes are fun, but I do not usually use them.  I also intentionally avoid the GPS related features for privacy reasons.* As another reviewer pointed out--be careful about turning it on while the lens cap is on--it can get stuck.Bottom line:An excellent camera for the price.  I can get good, solid, beautiful images (still or video) at about 1/10th the cost of what I paid for my SLR set.  I have a lot more features and much better zoom than with my pocket-sized point-and-shoot (Cannon Digital Elph... I forget the model number) at about the same price.  AND now I can video in HD.Recommended.
