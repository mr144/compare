it is good camera if you have a lot of patient waiting while processing. You can not just click click , you have to wait (processingggggggg) then click again for the next shot. I am using the fastest memory card I can get out there. This is my problem so I can not rate this camera's 5 stars. At least I give it a 3 stars. The other thing that disappoint me is made in CHINA. My previous Sony DSC 16.mega is made in Japan. The reason that I buy Sony cameras because they are made in Japan. This camera is not...By the way this is my 3rd sony camera. The 2 were made in Japan.
