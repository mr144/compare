This has given me mixed results. On Auto mode, sometimes very good (bright) quality pictures & sometimes shaky images. Looks like, the image stabilization is still not that perfect. It gives blur even if the object moves little.Another bad thing I observed is, the photos show distortion when I upload the photos to facebook. Probably I have to compress the file size. I have to try that.
