It seems to take really clear pictures - even when you are moving.  Video is crystal clear.  If you want to burn the video to DVD n HD you will need a blue-ray burner.  You will also need special software to view, edit, and encode the video's for burning to a DVD.  I downloaded &#34;Magix&#34; Movie Edit Pro from Amazon for this job.  It works pretty good but does take some time to encode.  Overall we have been happy with this camera.
