I got this for a trip/cruise to Portugal and Spain as I did not want to haul around my much heavier DSLR. While this is not a slip in pocket camera it is relatively light and I was amazed at the versatility and quality. I highly recommend it. It was really good at low light situations where a flash was not called for.
