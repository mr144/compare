I DON'T USUALLY WRITE REVIEWS, BUT REGARDING THIS CAMERA, I JUST HAD TOO!!! I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!. I HAVE TO SAY I AM A LOYAL FAN OF CANON CAMERAS, AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS ONE, ALL THE CAMERAS I OWN ARE CANONS... IM NOT ABOVE CHECKING OUT OTHER BRANDS THOUGH.. THIS SONY GIVES REMARKABLE PICTURE QUALITY., I LOVE HOW EASY IT IS TO USE. I WENT INTO THE SCENE MENU AND IT WAS A PIECE OF CAKE, ALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND IT EVEN TELLS YOU ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME WHAT IT ALL MEANS REGARDING WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR BEFORE TAKING THE PICTURE. IM SO GLAD I GAVE THIS SONY A CHANCE BECAUSE NOW ITS ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!!  DO LIKE I DID, TRY IT YOU'LL LIKE IT!!!  GOOD LUCK.. WANDA C., R.I.
