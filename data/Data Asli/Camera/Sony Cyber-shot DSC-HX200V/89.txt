This camera never ceases to blow my mind with the high quality images it produces. The shots are spectacular and it never disappoints. Of course, it does not deliver DSLR quality, but they still come out amazing. And the super zoom is so cool! I have used it over the course of the last few evenings to capture images of comet Panstarrs. They are brilliant and look better than some of the more &#34;professional&#34; photos I have seen of the comet. Buy this camera...it will not disappoint!
