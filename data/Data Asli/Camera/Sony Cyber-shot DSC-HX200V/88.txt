I always wanted to get a Digital SLR camera.  After reading many reviews, this one was the one I chose and I could not be happier.  The very fast auto focus, and read/write speed, simple manual controls, and an overall comfort of use make this one digital SLR camera I am happy to recommend to anyone who is either a newby, like my, to the SLR world, or to a veteran who needs a less-expensive back-up.  Take great shots and the zoom and macro zoom are  great.  The features are many, and I am still trying to figure out all of them to maximize the experience this camera has to offer.As recommeded by other reviewers, I did purchase a 32GB flash card with a 10 rating to use in it and have had no problems taking multiple pictures.I am very satisfied with this camera and highly recommed it.
