The camera so far (owned if for 3 weeks now) performed  as I expected.  The only gripe I have so far is that at zoom levels over 10x the autofocus does not function as well and the sharpness is noticeably lost.  I would expect as such after 30x but at 10x I did not expect such lose in picture sharpness.
