I absolutely love this camera. It has the ability to enhance anyone's photographic skills. It handles well, feeling quite good in your grip with the controls nicely placed. I am not overtly sophisticated and I am still learning more about the camera by the day. I'll probably never take advantage of every nuance of the camera but I am extraordinarily pleased with what I have been able to utilize. The 30X zoom is a godsend because I have found myself getting to take more and more wildlife pictures and I have gotten shots that I would never have had a chance to get were the optical zoom not as powerful. I have not had any issues with the automatic focus as has some others who had some issues with theirs. Best of all is I got an outstanding price (under $300) that made the decision to purchase the camera a no brainer. Wow, to think I might have missed out on some of the wonderful shots that I have been able to get since buying it! I have also own a Panasonic Lumix ZS19 camera that I love that has a 20X zoom and that fits easily in my pocket, making it so convenient to carry and get spontaneous shots. But when I am on a mission to take specific pictures I have been grabbing my Sony camera so as to use the powerful zoom. I have also been extremely pleased with the clarity and crispness of the shots I have been able to capture. The battery seems to allow an appreciable amount of shots and I bought a couple of additional batteries along with a charger so as to be prepared for any contingency. All in all this is a great camera!
