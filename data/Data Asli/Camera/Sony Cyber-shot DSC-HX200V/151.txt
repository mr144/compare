We are so pleased with the pictures we have taken with this camera.  We bought it for the zoom, and for the GPS feature for hunting trips and have not used those yet, but so far so good!I do need to talk to someone in customer support though as the battery charger was not in the box when we received it.  Once i get that, I'll be a happy camper!
