I am not a professional photographer and have no desire to become one. But I do want to be able to take great pictures with very little effort. This camera is amazingly easy to operate, but you will need to spend a few hours reading the detailed online instructions and putting the camera through its paces. For example, to view 3D photos, you have to follow a couple of steps or you will not see 3D. This camera is not a point-n-shoot camera, but the results are totally worth the effort to learn the basics of operation. One of the things I really like is the GPS tracking log. When I travel, every photo is automatically tagged with its GPS location. When I get back home, the camera's software allows me to quickly analyze the GPS tracking data and place the images onto a Google Map images - sweet! In fact, I place a image of the Google Map on my blog and when I update my images at night, the folks back home can see the photos I took that day and exactly where I took them. If you like technology and computers, you will love this camera.
