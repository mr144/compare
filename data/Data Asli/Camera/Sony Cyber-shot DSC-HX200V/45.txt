I had a trip planned to Yellowstone and Grand Teton. I needed a camera that would enable me to capture close-ups as well as long distance shots of scenery and wildlife, and have the option of taking HD movies of the guysers and moving wildlife. I also required a camera that had a fast auto-focus. I compared it in the store to the Nikon equivalent (42X), and there was no comparison on speed of focus at distance. This camera did it all. The pics and vids I captured from the trip are amazing. Everytime I tried to override the camera's automatic settings I degraded the results. Battery life was good as well, but I had back-ups just in case. I never had to go to a 2nd battery after a long day of shooting. This is a really smart camera and very versatile at the Enthusiast level. I noticed others at the Pro level trying to change lens to try to get various wildlife shots unsuccessfully. This camera was able to do it all with 1 lens.
