I returned a Panasonic because this camera had a better zoom and the landscape pictures were beautiful.  The exposure on automatic + is beautiful.  I do a lot of landscape and it handles multiple lighting and landscape scenes beautifully.  I have been a Canon and Panasonic user for years, but this one is my favorite.
