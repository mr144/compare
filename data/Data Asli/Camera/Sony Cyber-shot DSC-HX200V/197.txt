Had tried the Canon SX50HS but did not care for soft pics, so looking again.  Sony DSCHX200V seemed the best considering the Nikon P510.  Had shot Nikon SLRs for many, many years but tired of the weight so went to P&S camera. Was ready to try the Sony above but after reading the post regarding product support, downloading their software that erases MS Media Center, canned responses etc., going back to Canon, which is still built in Japan...not China or Indonesia.  Am disappointed since my previous experience with early Sony digital cameras indicated exceptional design, color and quality.  I might still purchase the Sony and make my own conclusions since the SX50HS produces less than anticipated sharpness.
