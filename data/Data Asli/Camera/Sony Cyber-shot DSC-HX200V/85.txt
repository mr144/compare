This was a replacement for my wife's older Kodak digital camera.  She really enjoys this one.  She takes a lot of outdoor pictures of the wildlife that hangs around the pond in front of our apartment. The pictures are very crisp and clear. It has taken her a bit to get used to the new menu system on this camera but now she loves it.
