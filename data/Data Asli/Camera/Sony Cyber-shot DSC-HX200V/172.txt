This has been a great camera.  Tons of great features, and easy to use.  You do not have to be a professional photographer to take some really great shots.  Does fantastic HD videos as well, panoramic shots (you click, hold and pan with the camera and it pieces the whole shot together for a cool shot), fun color features, etc..
