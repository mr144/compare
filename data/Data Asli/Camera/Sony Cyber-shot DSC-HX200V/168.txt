I like this camera, but would give it 3 1/2 stars. I got it too supplement a pocket sony cybershot dsc-tx1, that lacked good zoom. I am no expert photographer hence the point and shoots. But I do take lots of photos. I am still learning on the hx200v, and hope to master some more manual settings.Pros:* Good night shots* Good zoom if not trying to take close up pics (e.g. flowers, pets, people)* Standard daytime shots are all good, scenery is good (hiking, biking, outdoors)Cons:* Scene settings seem to get blur* Processing time after taking photos is too long (you actually see a processing temperature bar and have to wait til it is done - can not take rapid pics* Sport Scene setting (for taking rapid pics) is no help, pictures are way too dark and tons of blur* My BIGGEST beef with this camera is the inability to delete pictures!!!! You can not delete from a computer only directly from the camera. Pain in the a**.This is a perfectly fine camera but, I must say I really miss my Nikon coolpix 4300 which is why this review is 3 stars.
