I and my husband have been using this camera for more than 8 months now. We have gone through the specifications and prices of other cameras in this category before we finally order this camera and we love every feature of this camera. It is the best camera for this budget and clearly beats its competitors in this range. This camera comes with a cool GPS feature too, though we have not used it yet but it is good to have :). I strongly recommend this camera to my friends.
