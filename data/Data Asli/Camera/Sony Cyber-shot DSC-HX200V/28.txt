I did not have much time to practice before needing to use it for my daughter's preschool program. However, the in camera guide helped and I got better shots than I did with my and/or my husbands cell phone. I am sure that once I learn and practice with the camera I will be able to get better pictures and then I am sure I will love it. I spent a lot of time looking a cameras and deciding which one would be the best for our family and for the price and this one came out on top as well as being highly rated by several camera review pages. You can not just point and shoot like you would with other cameras and I recommend using the in camera guide to assist in getting the picture you want. I still need to watch the video available on how to use the camera but as I said even without viewing that and using the in camera guide I was still able to get great video and pictures of my daughter's program.
