Took it to Vegas, loved the clarity.Amazing speed, just what I was looking for.No issues with speed, or anything it all.In an auto mode, it was point and shoot with AMAZING results.I strongly recommend it to all.I did a lot of research and trial with Canon too, but this far surpassed it.Zoom was amazing.
