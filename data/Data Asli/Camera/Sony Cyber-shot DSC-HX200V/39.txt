As many pointed out I pretty much confer. The slow ZOOMING is something that bothers a bit but again to compromise the optical stabilization I can live with that. Lens cap is a bit bothersome you just need to remember to take it off before turning on after a while you will used to it. I purchased adapter tube too as I use filters most of the time. Newer version DSC-HX300 (around $500 or so as of 4/27/2013) has the thread so you do not need to purchase extra adapter tube. It also has a 50X zoom but with the sensors they used I will slightly suspect how well they perform. If you prefer a higher zoom camera I will suggest you to read more before you make the decision. If NOT then this one is a good and decent one to consider esp. I purchased at $279 (Amazon promotion back in February). Recommended.
