I bought this cameral for my wife before Christmas.  So far she is delighted with it. It was down to this camera or the Canon SX50.  We were looking for point and shoot features while adding some more flexability.  I am sure that we would have been happy with either.  One reason I liked the Sony was the Carl Zeiss lens and the larger lcd screen.  The longer lens and external flash shoe were attractive features on the Canon.  We shot lots of indoor pics during the holidays and the camera takes really nice flash pictures without washing out subjects.  Looking forward to playing with it outdoors.  Have had some trouble interpreting shooting modes from the online manual.  Probably some operator learning curve issues there.  Overall we have been very pleased with the Sony HX200X.
