I have a nature photo blog and have used various Sony cameras for almost 10 years and was very excited to get this camera, but I had to return it because it would not focus. I have since read many complaints about this, so no it was not just a defective unit unless there are many defective units out there with the same focus failure.  It appears to be an issue with this model. I went to the pond and could not even get it to focus in on a duck or a crane, it was just a blur.  Same with the mountains, same with my dogs.  None of my shots turned out.  That is the main thing a camera needs to do and it failed.  It does not matter if I can zoom in on something if I can not get a decent shot of it.There were other reasons to not like this camera:- The lens cap is awkward and each time I did go to take it off it would annoy me.- Does not come with a full user manual, just a small paper one that lacked detail.  With a camera like this, I expect a quality manual.  I do not want to have to go look it up online or get a pdf of it.  I want something I can carry with me and make quick references.- Does not come with a battery charger, you plug the camera in to charge it.- It had loads of features but they were not easy or quick to access.  If you are like me and just want a camera you can pick up and get the shot quickly, this is not it. There is a delay after each shot.  If you switch it to a scene mode, that screen stays on for several seconds before it allows you to take the shot.  It's like they packed it full of features at the expense of function.  When I started exploring the camera and all it is features I got excited, but when I actually went to use the them it was just a pain and frustrating.
