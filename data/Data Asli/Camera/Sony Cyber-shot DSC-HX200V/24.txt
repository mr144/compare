Still tinkering with it and figuring it all out but so far, it is everything I needed and more. The zoom on this is incredible and can take high quality pictures considering that distance. Not an issue thus far and still discovering new features I did not even know I would love until after I bought it. If you are a semi-professional photographer or even a point and shoot guy like myself using it on family events, with the price point, buy this already!
