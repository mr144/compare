Digital cameras have come along way from their film counterparts.  They still do not shoot the instant you press the botton and the complexity of choices may hinder you from selecting the best function the instant you need it.I still need to determine the best function to use to shoot moving water with a long exposure time to have it white streak the water.  And I have yet to use the firework function when we light off a large home arial displays or use the 1080p HD.The potential for this is awesome.  Close to instand review, memory sizes for an entire 10 day trip.  Hard to beat.
