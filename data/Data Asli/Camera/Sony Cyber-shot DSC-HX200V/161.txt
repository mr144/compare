I am so unexpected to find out that its image is not clear. Or, it is fuzzy.I am an amateur photographer, and I want to capture the beautiful sights in my life.This camera is the first one owned by my own. I spend 4 months to choose a fancy one, so you can imaging my feeling.It is a camera with a resolution of 18 millions, but even so you feel the image is not clear at all when you browse it at its actural size. (If you say that I should not browse it in its actural size, why it provides so fine a resolution?)It cannot compete with its competitors with only 16 or 14 million pixels.I feel my money spent is not well deserved. Or mine is one with deficiency? In that case, I may seek for a replacement or refund. But anyway it disappoints my enthusiasm.
