I have an old sony cyber shot and loved it until my son dropped it. This one takes way better photos. My old one always took blurry pics with out flash and this one so far has not. I have only had it a week or two. Still testing it out but so far seems great. One thing I do really like is that it has directions right in the camera all you have to do is press the ? button. The continous shooting is different then my old one and harder to use. The old one is better for that. but so far really happy with it and the price was great.
