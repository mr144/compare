Just received this today and am absolutely amazed by the quality of the photos and the endless options this camera offers just to take exceptional photos. The different shooting modes are great in a creative way, but I am most impressed by the quality of photos I have gotten in low light situations and at full 30 X zoom. I got great shots of a subject on a hill at least 2 miles away from my patio - and the detail in the photo was great! The panorama mode worked great as well and the LCD screen is one of the brightest I have seen on a camera. My last camera was a Canon G series that served me well for five years before I lost it in Miami, but the Sony is in a class by itself and it would be cruel to compare the two. I have not captured any movies yet but am confident the results will be fantastic as well. I highly recommend this camera based on its abilities, the quality of the photos you will get just from putting it on Intelligent Auto, and the fun factor Sony included with all the different modes for picture-taking and creativity that are included in this awesome camera.
