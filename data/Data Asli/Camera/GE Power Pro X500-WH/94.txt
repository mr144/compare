I bought this DSLR for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She was interested in photography so for the price and all the functions I bought this one as an entry level camera. Wanted to be sure her interest was a lasting one before I sunk money into a more expensive camera. Both her and I are very satisfied with the camera and I feel I made a good decision in purchasing this camera. I give it four stars only because it is not a top of the line DSLR but it is an awesome buy because of all the functions and capabilities of the unit. Like any camera of this type,it loves eating batteries. I would suggest that you also purchase some rechargeable batteries along with it.
