I purchased this camera just to have an extra camera to shoot when I do photoshoots. The quality of the camera was not so bad but did not work out the box. The battery kept dying and the camera would shut off. I changed batteries same thing again..so I sent It back for refund and will just be purchasing the Fujifilm hs30exr instead. I did rather spend a little more for better quality.
