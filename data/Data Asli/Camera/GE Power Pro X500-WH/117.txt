A really nice point and shoot.  Has more features than the average Joe will ever need, plus the zoom is fantastic.  I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she LOVED it.  Several of our friends have the super expensive DSLR cameras and they usually get jealous of hers, because it is so lightweight and simple to use.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
