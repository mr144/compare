I was looking for a camera to get for my birthday since I am interested in photography. I have only had this for about 3 days so I probably will update this peiordically.(or not) Now lets get down to buisness.Pros-1. The build- This is a very sturdy camera. Some people may not like the heaviness of it but I do like it.2. The looks- The Ge X500 is a very pretty camera. It just might be to me though.3. The zoom- The zoom on this thing is awesome for the price.4. The veiw finder- Every body knows this but I am going to state it again, not many cameras anymore have veiw finders. I love it for those sunny sunny days!5. Buttons- I love the lay out of the buttons. It is just so intuitive.Cons-1. The focus- The focus on the cam is not that good. You must give it time or you end up with a blurry pic.2. Slowness- This camera is not fast at all! You have to wait a little time (or alot) before taking another pic. Was I expecting it to be lightning fast? No. Was I expecting it to be faster. Yes. Was I expecting too much? Probably!!3. Video- I know, this is not a video camera or anything but I was expecting a little more quality sound. Again, expecting too much? Probably!!All in all, this is a pretty neat little thing. This is no slr or anything. This is a brige camera a.k.a. point and shoot on steroids. Again, I may or may not update.(only God knows!!!!)Update- I did not realize how painfully slow this is! I am sure I have to play with it more, but it is really slow. I do not know if I am being dramatic or what? Like I said, it is a average cam, one must play with it and make it work I guess.Update- I took a bunch of pics at my Uncles wedding. It did good on most everything except the battery life. It stinked on that. I had to use 12 alkaline batteries. 12!!! It did start to freeze up towards the end but that was totally to be expected since I took so many pictures.
