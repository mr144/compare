I bought this camera because of the reasonable price, and the fact that most reviewers said It's a good beginner camera. In the past, I have only had polaroids, and a point and shoot digital (sony cybershot). I go to a lot of concerts, so I wanted a camera with a good zoom so that I could take decent band pictures.I was so frustrated when I started using this camera. Outside, it was pretty decent, except the images were not as sharp as expected. However, inside, there was constantly noise, even when using a low ISO. In addition to that, you could not even zoom up to the halfway point without the image being really blurry. The focus seems to be really useless. I guess if you used this camera for a basic point and shoot (without using the zoom), it takes fairly clear images, and in that case It's good value for its price. I was just expecting so much more, and was really disappointed. However, yesterday I was fiddling around with it and discovered that if you put it into shutter speed mode, and use a fairly high shutter speed (I have it on 1/60 I think) and a flash, it seems to take pretty clear pictures with the zoom!! I am going to a concert this Friday and will test it out then, so hopefully it will work out as hoped.
