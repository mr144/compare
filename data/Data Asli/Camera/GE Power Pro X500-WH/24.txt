I was not sure about this camera I did not even know GE made cameras.  I read some of the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  I love it.  It is easy to use, has a great zoom and the pictures are amazing.  It arrived just before I had to take my grandsons to their first soccer game so I did not even have time to read the manual or anything.  I just put in the batteries and my SD card and left.  It was so easy to figure out how to use.  Also I have arthritis and the smaller cameras were hard for me to hold onto.  This one with it is molded hand grip was a joy to use.  As stated in another review the lens cover does not stay on very well but I took some rubber cement on a q-tip and rubbed it around the inside of the cover and let it dry completely and now it works just fine.  I also found out that Duracel copper top batteries will not work in it.  When the batteries that came with it died I put in the Duracel and it would not turn on.  I tried the Energizer batteries and it turned on.  So I do not know what was up with that but I have not had any problems with the Energizer batteries.
