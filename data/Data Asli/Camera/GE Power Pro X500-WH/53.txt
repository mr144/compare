After my 14MP camera met with a very mysterious accident, I began shopping for a new digital camera, and found this. It just arrived this morning, amazingly fast. I am still learning all the settings, but so far I am LOVING this! I did a lot of research before buying this, including the offerings at the store where I work and get a discount, and the prices were not even close. They were charging more for the 14MP version by about $50 dollars. I love the SLR style shape as I get a better grip, and the zoom switch is a dial surrounding the SHOOT button, which is very convenient. I did not check the MSRP on this camera, but I feel like I got a great deal. Granted, I am a hobbyist when it comes to photography but this camera looks like a steal!
