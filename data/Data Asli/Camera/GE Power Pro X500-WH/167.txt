Ok so before I purchased this camera I looked at reviews. Most people said that they loved it. If you are looking for a camera with high resolution pictures then this is not for you. When importing the pics from the camera unto a computer, the resolution will be at 72. There is nothing'pro' about that. So that did not cut it for me so I returned the camera.
