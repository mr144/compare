GE sucks. I bought this camera based on amazon reviews before taking a family trip to Ireland. We must have gotten a lemon. It worked fine before we went, but then, halfway through the trip, I had the awful discovery that 80% of my photos, which looked fine after I took them, had disappeared. Instead of my photos of the bucolic countryside, I saw nothing. White space. When I returned home and called GE, the first person I spoke with was sarcastic and unhelpful. I called again and was told to return the camera for  arepair' by GE technicians. More than a month later, they returned the camera with a note that they did not find anything wrong with it. The problem--some photos were stored properly while others were blanked out--continued. Then the stupid thing froze up entirely, with a fully charged battery. We called GE AGAIN, spoke to someone whose English could stand improvement, and were told essentially to kiss off. They were not going to do anything because their techs did not find anything wrong last time the camera malfunctioned. (Never mind that we were calling about a different problem.) I checked with Square Trade, whose warranty I had purchased, and they said they would not do anything while the camera was still under manufacturer's warranty. (Never mind that the manufacturer does not care about making good products nor about customer service.) Happily, we called Amazon customer service, told our sad and frustrating tale of woe, and the kind soul offered to send us prepaid mailing label and box to return the camera and they would refund our money. They even took back the case I bought for it. Awesome service, Amazon! Boo hiss, GE.
