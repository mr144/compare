I love my camera! I had a Pentax K1000 reflex 35mm camera, and it was an excellent camera. However, since the electronic photography took on, I was craving for another similar camera but without a big investment, since I am just a photography amateur. Well, the GE camera was not only a bargain but also a device full of good features for those who, like me, understand a little photography and want to take good pictures occasionally.Regarding the good pictures, I have used it for just a week, and I still have some things to tame this camera for, so I may update this review later but, for the time being, I am just happy with it.
