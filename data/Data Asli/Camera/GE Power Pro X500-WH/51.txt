I bought this camera as an alternative to a mirror. Because I did not want to carry a huge camera and its lenses. And I do not regret my purchase.This camera is made durable, very good menu, compact and very easy to use. There are many modes and settings, very much what is in the manual mode, many cameras at this price it is not.This is certainly not DSLR, but not inferior to it as images.But there is one drawback. Its screen is not exactly conveys quality, onscreen image is always worse than it actually turns out the photo.But even so the camera is good. I recommend buying.
