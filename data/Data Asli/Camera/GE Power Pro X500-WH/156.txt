I purchased this camera for my 20 yr old college daughter. She has not called with any problems. In fact she seemed to learn all the special effects in a day and loves using it to take photos at her sorority, college and R.O.T.C. events. I think it is the perfect camera for a novice and a real plus is the large viewing display and the digital eyepiece which helps when you are shooting in bright sunlight. It's a baby 35mm camera! I am a pro photographer and researched this brand/model to fit the photographic needs of my daughter. Wonderful little camera and easy to use.
