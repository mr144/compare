Took a risk hoping to get a good camera for $100.  You get what you pay for.  This will be my kids toy camera soon.  Just by an iPad or an iPhone and you'll never need another camera.  Oh well.  The picture quality is OK, but using (4) double A batteries is lame.  Also, the shutter speed is SO SLOW that you get about 1 good picture every 4 or 5 tries.  Any movement at all results in blurry pics.  Indoor pix look bad.  Will try selling it on ebay or Craigslist but will be honest about its limitations.
