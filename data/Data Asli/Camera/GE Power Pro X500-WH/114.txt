I can not turn the camera on.  The on button does not work.  Unfortunately, it is too late to return it.  Due to severe medical issues that occurred the same day the camera arrived, I did not get a chance to try it out.  Now I am just stuck with it.So from my point of view, it is a useless piece of junk.
