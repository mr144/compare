Disconcerting to see the large objective lens &#34;flower&#34; onto a pretty skinny stalk every time you turn this camera on. Decent camera but hard to believe 16 MP. Love the hand grip, size, and feel. SD card makes transferring a snap. Takes video good enough to post to YouTube. A somewhat glorified instamatic. Worth the money, you'll probably want a more serious camera for your inner artiste.
