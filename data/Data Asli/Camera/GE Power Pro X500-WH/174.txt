I purchased this GE camera for myself. The Power Pro X500 takes very good, clear pictures. It is not too big as I read from previous reviews. I have large hands but the controls are really accessible. Battery life is pretty decent and keeping an extra four on hand is not a bad idea. Personally, I like dealing with a 'normal sized' sd card. It is a lot easier to load and unload as opposed to the micro sd cards. It is a good camera, or 'bridge' camera as is the term. I did not by it for that purpose. I made the purchase just to shoot a few nice pictures without shelling out a lot of hard earned cash. I think some will appreciate this camera.
