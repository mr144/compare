The camera is great for macro and panoramic photos.It's when you take close up zoom photos of small subjects like snails and flowers that the zoom and focus issues arise.A right equidistance from the subjects is required for zoom and focus to work properly.Otherwise just do a close up photo without the zoom.It's software is excellent you can do a lot of enhancements and manipulations to your photos.And sketching and drawing photo only this camera is capable of such with it is setting.On taking photos of the moon.Once I got the right photo with focus and white balance the moon came out in detail with no over light glare.But I can not seem to repeat it again.That's all I can say. Next time I might get a GE X600 with 26x zoom or a Fuji finepix S4200 with 24X zoom.
