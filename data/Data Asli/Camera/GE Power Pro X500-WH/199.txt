I loved this camera. I am not a professional, but I thought it took great pictures for my purposes. But we have only had it about a week, and I am having to change the batteries every day. We have a battery tester and it is telling me GOOD batteries are BAD. That is unacceptable. I shudder to think how many batteries people who do not have a battery tester just throw away thanks to this camera. I did read a few reviews about the batteries not lasting long, but thought they were probably just being picky. They were not. We are returning it. The camera search continues...
