I bought this camera a year ago and for one year it worked well. Eats up batteries in no time so have a lot handy. A couple of days ago I could not download my pictures or movie clips. I tried changing the cable to no good. So now what good is a camera that can not download. My little Kodak served me well for 5 years before it started to to the same thing.When you look at the mini ports that are used, it is no wonder why things like this happen.Anyway it is back to Walmart to pick up another $100.00 camera. I wonder how long this one will last. All this digital stuff is nice and fancy but unless you pay top dollar you are basically getting junk. I had my old fashioned Leica for twenty years.
