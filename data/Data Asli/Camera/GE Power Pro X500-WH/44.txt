It is my first digital camera. I had a 35mm for many years. So far it has met all of my expectations. Excellent quality and price. Some have expressed  disappointment of the CD instead of a manual. I called the number on the yellow card and spoke to customer relations. There is a PAPER MANUAL for this camera and they will mail it to you. This is what I did. Also, the warranty covers CANADIAN purchases from the U.S. for this camera.  Hope all have many happy memories.
