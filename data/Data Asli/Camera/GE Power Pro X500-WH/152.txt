I am starting this 1 star review off by saying I loved this camera. I brought it June, 5th and began using it in mid-July after I got the rechargeable batteries and a memory card. I took a ton of beautiful pictures. And then right at the 3 month mark it broke. The software or whatever is in these things went crazy. It began switching rapidly from one program to the next and would not stay in one mode.  I stopped focus and when it did focus the colors severely skewed and the whole think just went crazy at once. I have sent it back to Amazon for a partial refund. I am not stupid enough to attempt a manufacturer warranty. I think something like that would make me crazy. I liked the camera so much that I might just purchase another one and hope it lasts. I think if I purchase it at Wal-mart they will give me a full refund with in a year. I think? It was a nice camera, I miss it.
