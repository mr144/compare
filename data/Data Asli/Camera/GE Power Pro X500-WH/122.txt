I was looking for a camera with excellent zoom, and this camera fits that nicely - I rarely use the full optical zoom and never use the digital zoom, and still get excellent results. Besides the zoom feature, this camera is packed with options for taking pictures, and even when you let the camera set exposure and lighting, the results are quite good.My previous camera (an Olympus) required me to 'photoshop' pictures to get really good results; with the GE, just a few minor tweaks are all that are needed to get quality results. This is going to be my main camera for many years to come.
