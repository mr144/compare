When I finally figured out the problem, the camera worked well and I now like the camera. The problem was the crummy batteries provided with the camera. They were not powerful enough to work the memory chip. I thought the memory chip was bad. The batteries provided with the camera only let me take 9 pictures and then the camera said the memory was full. The memory could handle 9,999 pictures, not the 9 the poor batteries would allow.
