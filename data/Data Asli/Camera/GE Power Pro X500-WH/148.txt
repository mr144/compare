I only gave the GE X500 three stars for the following reasons. Difficult to focus at advertised minimum distance, 30 second max shutter (no bulb setting), more camera shake/unsharpness even at 1/200(handheld) than it should have. This is still a wonderful camera for the price! I have blown up images to 20X30 with great results. Low light is difficult in some situations too. I found anything over 400ISO way too noisy for me. I shoot in manual mode most of the time and use a tripod. GE would do well to add/fix a few things and up the price a bit to really make this a contender. If your looking for an auto point and shoot only, I would have to suggest a different camera. However, if your know how to use the settings and have a good understanding of camera functions, this camera can shine! I retired my film SLR and did not want/need the expense of a DSLR. The GE has done nicely for me but may not be for the newbie!
