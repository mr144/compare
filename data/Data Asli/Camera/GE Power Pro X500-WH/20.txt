I really can not say much bad about this camera. It is as described. Light weight, easy to handle and takes great pictures EXCEPT....close-ups. I mean really close up. I am a little disappointed in my close-up pictures. I have a small Samsung that has a 5X zoom and I can use it for really close close-ups but I was hoping I would not have to carry two cameras. All other pictures are wonderful with this camera. I love the view finder and that is one of the main reasons I bought it. I have 15X zoom Nikon that works great but it does not have a view finder and I find it is necessary in the bright sun. I bought this camera because it appeared to have everything my Nikon had with the addition of the view finder. It takes pictures just as good as my Nikon and I paid 1/3 of what I paid for my Nikon. It is a really great camera for the price. The close-up problem is not a deal breaker for me. I love the camera and will keep it.
