I admit it. I am terribly rough on cameras. I wear them around my neck or carry them on a strap around my wrist so they bang into all kinds of things. I drop them. I put them in my purse with 10 pounds of other stuff. After several years, it was time for a new digital camera for my three weeks in Europe. I am not a super photographer. I do not blow my photos up into posters or enter them in contests. I do not know enough to use fancy settings available on high dollar cameras, and I frankly do not have time to learn. So my criteria were pretty simple: sturdy case to withstand banging about on a strap, autofocus, at least 8x optical zoom, decent pixel count to create an occasional 8x10 if I should happen to get a really nice shot, and easy review and deletion. My sister, who is a very good photographer, had purchased this unit for a quick, 'go to' camera to carry in her car, bag or wherever. She was pleased with it and showed me some photos she had taken, including a panorama. I had no idea GE even MADE cameras, so I had low expectations. But seeing her shots, playing with her camera, and comparing the price to other brands with similar features sold me. After using it during my travels, I love it. It has good image stabilization so I had fewer blurry photos than usual, colors are natural, the zoom is powerful, and I was crazy about the panorama setting which was really easy to use. All this and more for far less money than other brands with fewer features. I highly recommend this for the average person who just wants to take photographs for personal memories!
