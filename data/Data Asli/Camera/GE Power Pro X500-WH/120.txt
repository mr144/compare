I absolutely adore this camera. It gives you the effects, style and settings of a DSLR camera but is as simple to figure out as a point and shoot. Picture quality is great aswell. Best part is it is only about the size of a point and shoot. Just a thicker body to it. Highly recommened buying this camera! It's a small price for a good camera. Only bad thing is the manual is on a CD. Other than that, love it.
