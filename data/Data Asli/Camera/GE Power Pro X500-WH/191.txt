You can buy almost any camera with big buks attached to it. But this little camera has just about all the functions you ever really need in a nice priced camera. There are still a few functions that I have not fully mastered with this camera, but at this point in the game I am totally satisfied with this camera and I would recommend it to the better than average picture person. As it is with most multifunction cameras one has to learn how to use all the bells and whistles. I say folks for the money and at 16 mp you just can not beat it.  KW
