I read the reviews for this camera and was kinda skeptical at first until my teenager got this as a gift for Christmas and he LOVES it!!!  Great camera for someone starting out as an amateur photog.  Thanks Amazon for the drop in price also.  Ca not go wrong with this one.  Fast service too.  Takes great pics too even without the flash.
