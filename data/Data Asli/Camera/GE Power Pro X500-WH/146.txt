I am still making friends with my new GE camera, but so far it has performed admirably. I am taking a photography class and still learning how to use the  amanual' settings for more artistic control but the auto ones I have taken look great! I am happy that I purchased the GE Pro 500 camera. It was one of three recommended by my teacher as a good 'starting' cameras.I had checked the usual sources available to me (Radio Shack, Walmart etc) looking for the best prices and Amazon.com not only beat their prices but blew them away even after shipping was included! It arrived in 2 days!
