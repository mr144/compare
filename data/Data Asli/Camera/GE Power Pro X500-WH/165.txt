I wanted to upgrade from a regular digital camera, but was not quite ready for a dslr.  The camera is really cute, but unfortunately that does not really matter.  It sucks up a lot of batteries, which are a pain to keep on hand when you are out shooting pictures for a day.  The quality of the pictures were great and it has a really neat pencil drawing function.  But I gather that you could find a better quality digital camera that has a longer battery life.  I did end up purchasing a Canon Rebel T3i.  And I have not even touched the GE camera since.  Save your money and either buy a normal digital camera or save up for the real deal.  This hybrid does not really cut it.
