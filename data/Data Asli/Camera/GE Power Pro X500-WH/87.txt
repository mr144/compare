Amazing camera. I have paid a lot more for much less quality and performance. I am a jiggler and I tried to jiggle the camera while I was taking a photo. It was an excellent photo. NO BLURRING! This camera is extremely easy to use and I am going to tell all my friends about it. I prefer a viewfinder to take photos, especially outdoors on a sunny day where you can not tell what you are aiming at without a viewfinder. I love it!
