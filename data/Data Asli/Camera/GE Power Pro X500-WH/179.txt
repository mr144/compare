I purchased this Camera to replace my point_and_shoot cameras.Setup is easy.The mass amount of features and manual settings are overwhelming. I would sit and look through the user manual page by page, and maybe find some good photography tips. So far I have only dabbled with the Manual settings, as they are complicated and intimidating. That being said- I think this camera has massive potential.I am by no means a professional photographer, but like to take good pictures.Overall, this is a great camera with way too many good things and features to list in a review. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.Pros:Great PriceLightweightGood BrandLots of features & preset scenesGood zoomCons:Ca not get attachable lenses such as telephoto.The beeping sound on each key press has to be manually turned off each time you turn the camera on.It comes with a set of 4 batteries but  no SD Card. I purchased the Transcend SDHC Card and it works great. I also purchased the Zeikos medium camera bag and it perfectly holds this camera as well as my other 15 MP point and shoot and my 4 MP Bridge.Conclusion:If you are not worried about being a complete professional, but want to take professional type of shots- this camera is for you as long as you do not mind doing a little reading and/or taking some classes in photography.
