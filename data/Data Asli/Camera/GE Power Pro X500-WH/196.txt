This is the third digital camera I have purchased for my family to use, the first being a kodak 810 pixel nightmare, and the second a fujifilm 12 megapixel, which took great pictures, but was stolen. This replacement is more than adequate to my present needs, at a great price. It takes good photos indoors and out on the automatic settings if you wait long enough for the sensor to analyze and set up the shot you selected. I am sure as I get more familiar with the camera I'll like it even more. So far, I think I made a great purchase.
