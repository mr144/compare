Most appealing thing about this camera was the price...we were looking for an inexpensive option that would allow some decent zoom...seems to be kind of hit and miss with it is abilities...sometimes it will auto focus well, sometimes not...even when you are basically taking the same picture you did right before...and the opening and closing of the flash is annoying...seems like they could have just placed it on the front in the open position to allow for easier operation
