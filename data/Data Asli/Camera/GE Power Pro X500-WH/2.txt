I bought this camera few days ago.  I am experienced user of such equipment but I bought this to check out the features mainly because of the price.  Let me say this at the start.  If you have never used any such equipment before then this is a very nice product.  You get a lot of features for a reasonable price.  So far the camera is operating properly.  I can not speak for the longevity of the product yet.  Here are some of the pros and cons:PROS:.  Lots of features for a small price..  Reasonable looks..  Good optical zoom..  Picture quality is reasonable.  Many picture settings are available..  Nice panorama picture taking.  Decent software provided with the camera..  The use of the camera and the controls are intuitive and easy.  Electronic view finder for the eye is nice..  Battery life is decent.CONS:.  Optical zoom is smooth, digital zoom is jerky.  At extreme zoom, the view finder shows mis-focused picture but the saved picture is OK..  The sound recording quality is not good.  The sound recorded with the movies is most pathetic.  Movie without sound is OK.during movie playback on the camera, the sound is not good..  For a 16 MP camera the picture quality is not at par with other manufacturers but then you get what you paid for!Result:I would say that if you are looking for a camera with lots of features at a very reasonable price then this is not a bad product.  Do not try to compare with higher priced cameras.Good luck.
