This is the second point and shoot camera I have had. I had a Canon but dropped and damaged. I tried the GE, unfortunately, must return. The picture quality is awful. It is difficult to handle and it would take several tries to put the flash on auto. Hopefully, I will find something in this price range of better quality.
