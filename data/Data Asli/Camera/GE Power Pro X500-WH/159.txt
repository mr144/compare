I intended this camera to be a gift for my son for his seventh birthday. Our family goes on photography dates and he borrows my DSLR camera. I thought this would be a great camera before I invest in a SLR camera for him. This camera was not even suitable for a seven year old. I would hope I had a defective camera because it would not make any sense for a camera such as the GE Power Pro X500-BK to even be made with how it functioned. If you feel like you would like to purchase this camera I would advise you to go check it out in person first.
