I wanted to finally upgrade from my point_and_shoot, super old Sony Cybershot and this camera has been so much fun so far. It has some features of a point_and_shoot, but a lot of the features of a more sophisticated camera. I am still learning how to best use the different settings, but so far it is well_worth the price point.
