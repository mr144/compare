I was looking for an inexpensive digital SLR to replace my old camera, a Kodak that had many problems . The GE Power Pro X500 is not really classified as such, but it sure performs like one! It has loads of features that much pricier cameras have, and a few surprises of its own, such as the panorama mode (although I recommend a tripod for this unless you have a steady hand),several specialty settings, including one for shooting through glass, landscapes, sunsets, plants, night, indoors, and several others that I used with good results. My prints were true-to-color and sharp, even after considerable cropping.I purchased this camera because it had an optical view finder as well as LCD display, the 16MP, and the 15X optical zoom. I was hesitant about the battery life, but have been very satisfied. It's much easier to pop in fresh batteries than to wait for one to recharge, and battery life was longer than I expected. Aside from the occasional focusing problem, which a  areboot' seemed to cure, this camera met my expectations for the price and then some. I do recommend reading the manual-on-CD and practicing with the various settings before taking important photos. I did so, and once comfortable with this camera's abilities and limitations, I was thrilled with the results!
