So far I really love my GE camera.  Have had it for about 6 weeks.  It is taking very good picturesand the videos are quality also.Battery life seems pretty good but always like to have some back-ups with me.  So far I have justused new batteries and have not gone to rechargeable ones.  I have enjoyed the process of getting toknow my new camera but still have more to learn.  I just had a point and shoot before this but thisseems to offer so much more.
