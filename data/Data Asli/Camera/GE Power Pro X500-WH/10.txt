This is a great camera. It takes perfect pictures. Even if your hand is a bit shakey, the picture is perfectly sharp. I used Energizer batteries in the camera and they lasted well. The only problem I have encountered is that the battery compartment door is a bit hard to open and close. After a few uses, the hinge on mine broke. Maybe I was not careful enough with it. To get it replaced, the camera must be mailed to GE in California for replacement. The charge is $30. Otherwise, this is a great camera.
