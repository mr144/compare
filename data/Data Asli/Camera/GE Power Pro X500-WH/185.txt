I bought this camera to take prom pictures. It took great pictures but the camera kept shutting off. Then it would come on. I replaced the batteries and it lasted for a few shots and back off it went. Replaced the batteries again, this time it would not come back on. I was going to return it but my 30 days expired. I called the GE company and it was going to take 21 days for them to look at the camera and let me know what was wrong with it. It does not take 21 days to know it does not work. Well I was not happy waiting that long so I took the camera apart. Theres not much to it but then I did not know what I was looking at anyway. I will buy this camera again but I will buy it locally so I can take it back to a store if it does not work. I only had this camera for a week when it started acting up.
