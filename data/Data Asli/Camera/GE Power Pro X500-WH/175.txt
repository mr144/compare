Product was as described. Information was on disk: Have NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET THE DISK TO LOAD! CAMERA SITS HERE UNABLE TO UMDERSTAND HOW TO USE! Use to love GE products No More. There are still some of us that prefer printed information. At my age 73 its easier for me.  At least should have been given option to get it in order to use the camera.
