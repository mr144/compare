I have owned many cameras over the years, I am 49 years old, I really enjoy taking pictures of all kinds of things, the wife & I both ride motorcycles & love shooting pictures of the mountains waterfalls & nature, but this camera really do not work worth a flip, batteries, yes we have used rechargeable & high dollar non chargeable one too, but that's not the issue, this camera just takes bad pictures, we will shoot 50 pictures, & only 10 might come out, we have tried everything, so be smart, do not buy this camera.
