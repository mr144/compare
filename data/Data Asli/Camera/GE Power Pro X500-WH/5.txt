This camera is amazing!! It takes great photos. Sometimes I feel a little too good. lol. It is worth the price if you want something better then the other smaller cameras. This one has so many settings you can choose. We always set the settings ourselves but you can let the camera do it automatically. Anyways, its a great camera so if you want and awesome camera get this one. You will not be disappointed!
