I love this camera! It's small. It's amazing. The zoom goes very very far. The picture is SO CLEAR wether zoomed in or not. The recording is awesome. The one bad thing is the batteries over heat easily for me. & I have leave the camera alone for like 10 minutes. Another than that, everything else is amazing!
