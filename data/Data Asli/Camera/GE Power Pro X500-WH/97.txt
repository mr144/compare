I just love my Camera, i just Adore the way it looks! I still do not know how to use it very well, but the pictures ive made, are great! Im still learning a lot about it and its beautiful. Perfect size (not as big as other cams, not as small as a simple point and shoot), perfect weight. I just find difficult to find the perfect case for it...instead of that, Im totally happy. PS: GO for the white, you will fall in love!
