I purchased this camera, based upon a review I had seen in the local newspaper. Man, was it wrong ! I do mostly appraisal work; thinking the camera would be perfect for the interior shots of houses. It turns out that the camera is not worth the price of the paper the review was written on. I cannot get the camera to 'focus' on my intended subject's. I talked to a GE rep on the phone & he walked me thru the process (I must mention that I have been a 35mm photographer for over 35 years). Still the camera will not focus & give me a sharp image.Either the internal workings of the camera are corrupted or there is another problem. Either way, I am getting another camera - another brand too.Sorry GE; I rate you - useless !
