I do art photography for a living, so about 90% of my product is about the editing after the photo, but this camera takes such beautiful photos, it cuts about half an hour off of my editing because there's so much clarity in the photos. They come out SO vivd and just lovely! There's a setting for pretty much any kind of lighting or set, and the zoom quality is amazing! A good photographer friend of mine owns a $2,600 camera, and says the images she's seen from this camera are just as good as the ones that come from hers! I HIGHLY reccomend it! People are blown away when I tell them how little it cost!! Be sure to also get an SD card as theres not much of an internal memory, and I also suggest ordering a case as well. I found one on her for about $9, and it is perfect for this camera. I could not be happier!
