This camera took really good pictures for the price I paid for it, and I took amazing care of it. However, after 6 months of having the camera, IT WOULDN'T TURN ON. I did absolutely nothing for this to happen. One day I went to turn it on, and it would get stuck and would just turn off. I do not know if mine was just defective or what, but I would not recommend this camera to anyone.
