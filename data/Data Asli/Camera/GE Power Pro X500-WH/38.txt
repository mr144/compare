Little smaller than I expected, and takes good pictures & videos. Looks good in white, replacing the batteries is a pain and adds some weight to this thing. I hate the software that came with this, but I use adobe so I might be biased. Worth the price if you plan on recording memories and want good shots. Would suggest this to novice photographers and someone who wants a decent camera for short money.
