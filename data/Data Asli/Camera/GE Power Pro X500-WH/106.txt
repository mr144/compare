I read many of the reviews on different cameras before deciding on this one, and I have not been disappointed! The pictures are beautiful, and menu is easy to navigate. There are so many different features, but the best one is ASCN, which figures out which kind of picture you want to take (lighting, background, people are all taken into account automatically! Great for a person like me who has never owned a camera and needs to learn.The only problem I have with this camera is the delay between pushing the button and the actual taking of the picture. A few of the reviews mention this, so I know I am not the only one.
