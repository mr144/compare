I ordered this camera because I wanted tk take better photos of my children then a point and shoot. You can not beat the price.  I also enjoy taking photos of nature and that is now my favorite part of thos camera. This camera is high quality,  very easy to store and handle,  and light.  I still have no idea how to use all the functions but I am completely thrilled with my choice on getting this camera. My only issue would be it takes a moment to shoot and with young children I miss some good shots. I rate it 5 star and for the price and the quality it earns 5 stars
