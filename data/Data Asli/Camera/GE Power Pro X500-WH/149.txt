I debated on what camera to go with, wanted an easy to use camera under $200.00. WORST CHOICE. I have had the camera for about 3 months. The first few weeks I figured it was just me needing to get used to it. Nope, it just sucks. Yesterday, while on a camping trip it stopped taking pics. Makes a loud humming noise and wont let me view pictures off the sim card either. Not to mention the camera on my iphone spits out wayyyyyy better pictures. Very disappointing, will be attempting to return
