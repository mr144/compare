When I read the reviews on this camera I thought I had done enough research, but I did not. The camera is fine if you take shots in a lot of light and the objects are not moving at all. Other than that if you try and use the zoom the shots are grainy and if you are in a dim place again they are grainy. It could have gotten a much cheaper point and shot rather than this. I have to purchase another camera for my needs and this one does not do it at all.
