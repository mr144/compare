This camera is everything and than sum....price is great, options on camera are great, picture quality is great, love the white color. Comes with pretty much everything you need to start snapping away....Only gripe: wish it came with a camera bag of some sort!Had to buy that and memory card sepretly!But I figure...if you can not afford to buy a memory card and a little cheap camera bag, than you can not afford this amazingly priced camera! :)
