Good camera, nice zoom with good quality, seems to be a little fragile, the screen on one of ours went white on us, but got it exchanged and the new one is fine.  It has a good weight and feel, pretty small too. it is odd the the eyepiece is connected to another lcd screen instead of the actual lens but this camera performs well and makes you look like you know what you are doing haha, and has nice options for your custom picture. Glad I bought it.
