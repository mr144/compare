I have an OLD Nikon 5mp which takes clearer pics. I have a hard time getting any good shots with the GE. I photograph my 6 children 2x's a year. Then menu is a jumbled nightmare and I am a huge tech geek. If your subject has days to get one good pic then this cam is for you. The battery life is good on reg duracells. the lens cover pops off when lens extends. I am trying to mention good things. I think my kids will enjoy playing with this one.
