best camera ive ever owned to date not my first digital but the best one takes great video and though you cant tell from the picture it does have a very bright flash if you push the button on the left side top. could not be happier with how it works. it even came with batteries in the package so it could be used right away. way too many options to try and list i do not even think i can use them all if i tried to.
