I am in a developing nation in the Pacific teaching college and wanted a camera that (#1)  took standard AA batteries (available everywhere around the world AND I can use over the counter rechargeables) and (#2) was sturdy.  For the price, I am very happy with this camera.  Make no mistake, it is heavy (has a metal body, NOT plastic) and requires 4 AA's (not a hardship because I can recharge them).  I guess you might find one lighter that uses AA's or AAA's, but this works for me.  The one caveat I guess is that though it comes with a USB cable... I do not know why.  It did not come with software (just a manual on CD) and when I connected it to my computer, it was not detected as a USB drive.  I bought a 16GB SD Card with it and my laptop has an SD card slot, so I can download my pictures and videos... but if you do not have an SD card slot, I do not know what you would do.  Oh... one more thing.. though the camera takes great pictures and videos, the mike is on the side and does NOT record sound as well as other cameras I have used.  If sound is important for your purposes, I do not think I would recommend this camera.
