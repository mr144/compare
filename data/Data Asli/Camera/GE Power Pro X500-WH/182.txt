Have only had this camera a little over 24 hours and can say I am really impressed and happy! Resolution is awesome! Can enlarge photos to small poster size without graininess. Speed is decent with the right settings (still playing with learning those). Zoom is amazing! Took daughter to the zoo today. Took a zoom shot of a polar bear at over 40 ft and every hair is well defined! Battery life is best I have had with any digital camera. Changing settings is fast and simple. Complex enough for difficult shots for me and simple enough to point and shoot for my 9 y/o daughter. I love being able to switch between LCD or viewfinder with one button! Nice! Have not tried dark shots but love that it goes all the way up to 3200 ISO. (Done lots of existing light shots in the past.) I do wish they had made the lens cover built in on this but no huge complaint. May add to this review later, after more experience with this camera. Really happy so far!
