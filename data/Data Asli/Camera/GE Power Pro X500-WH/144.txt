My husband bought this to replace my older camera, It was on time and getting the camera out it was well packaged, Loaded the batteries in the camera, Its a nice camera, It's a little heavier than my last camera which was a Kodak When it was drop it is totally broken, :-(, So My husband got online and started searching and he was very happy with the views on the camera, When it showed up I was excited to see just how good this camera would be, Because I had stood up for Kodak for years, Well I am loving this new camera and I really like the grip of it, The photos seem sharp and clear, I feel happy he choose this camera, It comes with a nice strap So you can carry around your neck and maybe this one will not be dropped, Because we was out of alot more money with the one from Kodak,This camera is worth the price and I would buy another one just like this one, Thank you Amazon, Betty
