This order was awesome. I was a bit finicky at first as I am a first time buyer at Amazon and moreover I was pondering whether to buy a Canon or Nikon. Anyway, I had come across the GE Camera and I thought to myself that this was too good to be true so I bought it to check it out and it was the best order ever done so far in my experience with online shopping. I am glad I bought this item and I love Amazon!
