This camera has all the bells and whistles of its more expensive counterparts and in some cases even takes better pics!LOL no but seriously, I have taken upwards of 1000 pics w this already and I have been booked for weddings and parties already...Im just an amateur photog but i guess the bug got me due to this lovely little cam! This think is DEF worth the money, esp if your thinking of buying junior his first cam or just getting one for vaca pics but not spending a ton of money! Def worth it!
