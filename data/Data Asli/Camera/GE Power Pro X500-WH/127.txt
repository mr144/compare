This is a great camera for a beginner like me. Easy to use and easy to understand. It takes wonderful pictures and the price is great too! It has settings for tons of applications like nighttime, portrait, panorama, too much light, too little light, etc. The list goes on and on. The only thing I do not like is the manual which is on a disc to view on your computer etc. I like paper manual books personally.  So I found myself printing out the pages I needed to study better. Overall though a fantastic camera!
