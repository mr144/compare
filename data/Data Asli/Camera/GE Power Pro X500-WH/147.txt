I love this camera! I purchased the bundle, which came with a cleaning kit, 16g SD card, four inch tripod, carrying strap, and carrying bag. I am a total amateur, but wanted something just a step up from plain point and shoot cameras. Be warned, when you review the images taken on the cameras lcd screen, they can actually differ greatly from the actual image when reviewed on the computer. The camera saves a thumbnail image and I have been fooled by it a couple of times, when the image did not turn out as great as the thumbnail looked. If you do not get the bundle, you really need to purchase a separate SD card, or you are only going to have room for 4 or 5 pictures. I am very pleased with my camera.Update 2/25/13This camera is still awesome. I love all the different options and everyone raves about the pictures I take with it. Best camera I have ever had!
