I originally bought this to replace my standard point and shoot camera, I was not ready to take the plunge into a DSLR camera but I wanted more than what most point and shoot cameras offered. I had ready many reviews on this camera and through all the pros and cons I still felt it was a good buy for me.This camera is a bit on the heavy side but once I used it a time or two I got used to it and now I do not even notice the weight. It took me a minute to get my settings how I wanted them, and when I am taking photos in a different environment I take a few test shots before getting started. I really enjoy the zoom, I have snapped some amazing photos using the full zoom and they turned out great. The flash is nice, but I do not find myself using it all that much, many other reviews stated that this is not a great camera for low light areas but I have not had an issue with it.Overall I do not have any real Cons to share, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something more without going over the top.
