I have 40+ years in photography, originating in the US Air Force.  I bought this camera for my wife who is reluctantly making the digital transition from 35mm film cameras.  With that in mind, the camera I purchased for my wife had to have simple & advanced features with the feel of a 35mm camera at an affordable price.  The weight & handling is superb with easy access to function buttons & dials, with a right-hand wrap-around grip.  A big plus is the electronic viewfinder, especially for using in bright sunlight or if you have a tremor.  The lens works smoothly & the flash has a fill range up to 20+ feet.  These features are rare on cameras this size & for this low price ($115).After I became familiar with its operation, I took my wife & the camera on a training expedition a couple weeks after receiving it.  She had a blast with it just using the basic features with great pictures (some were manipulated using the software that comes with the camera).  I can not wait until she learns & experiences all the potential this camera has ... wow factor!You will read some reviews that complain about poor picture quality but that may be due to their own inexperience in photography or using this camera.  To counter that perceived issue, when I received the camera, I simply set the camera at 12MP or 8MP & set the ISO limit to 400; thereby, allowing greater latitude for pictures regardless of lighting.  In addition, you want to take note not to push the zoom lens into the  didigital zoom' range, unless using a tripod.  An optical zoom is more refined & stable.  By observing these tweaks, you can improve overall picture quality by improving resolution.  My wife & found that this camera takes superb pictures ... & you can too with a little practice & some tweaks.So I would recommend this camera to novice & professional photo enthusiasts alike.  I had a blast using this camera also when my wife would allow me to hold it.
