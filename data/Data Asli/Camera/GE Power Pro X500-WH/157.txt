I WANTED A REALLY GOOD CAMERA FOR OUR RECENT TRIP TO EUROPE BUT DID NOT WANT TO SPEND A FORTUNE. I ASKED MY SON, MR. TECHNOLOGY, WHAT HE RECOMMENDED AND HE TOLD ME WHAT HE HAD JUST PURCHASED. I STARTED LOOKING AROUND, BUT COULD NOT AFFORD HIS PRICE RANGE. WHEN I CAME ACROSS THIS GE, I REALIZED IT WAS A STEP UP FROM WHAT HE RECOMMENDED FOR LESS THAN 1/2 WHAT HE HAD PAID OUT. WHEN HE SAW IT, HE SAID, WOW MOM! THIS IS A BETTER CAMERA THAN MY NEW FUGI. WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS BABY? I TOLD HIM AND HIS JAW JUST DROPPED. HE TOOK SEVERAL PICTURES WITH IT AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED.SEE, OLD DOGS CAN LEARN NEW TRICKS;-)
