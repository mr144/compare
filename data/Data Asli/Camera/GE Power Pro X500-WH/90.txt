I love my camera and the pictures that it produce. What I hated was, after taking all the pictures and after installing the program on my computer to download the pictures. It took me for ever to figure out how to get the pictures to download only because the directions was not really clear - I went by the direction, but they did not work. The directions did not tell what you can do if following the directions failed - need more directions.Thanks
