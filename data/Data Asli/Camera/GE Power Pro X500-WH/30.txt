Pros: Only takes Double A batteriesTakes fantastic picturesCons: Only 1 con really... The LCD display on the camera is not that high quality, makes you think the pictures are bad when you first take them, only other thing I did not like about it (was not a CON really) was the EVF is a display SCREEN, not sure if most cameras are doing that now but it threw me off that I had to switch from EVF to LCD
