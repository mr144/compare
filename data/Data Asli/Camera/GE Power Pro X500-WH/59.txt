My only other camera is the original Minolta auto which takes great film pics, except for low-light situations.  I looked around a LOT for a starter-level digital __that had a VIEWFINDER__, which is really necessary for outdoor shooting where you can not see the screen and I find quite a bit easier and faster to frame shots with.  The digital viewfinder is not as good a TTL one, but it makes the camera so much easier to work with that I am surprised they do not charge a premium for the feature.  I find it very easy to use and especially like the broad zoom range.  Works exceptionally well in low light.  Could have just a slightly larger grip area for big hands, but it is still adaptable.  Would not hesitate to buy it again.Very pleased.
