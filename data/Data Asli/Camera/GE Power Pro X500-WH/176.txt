i purchased this camera thru amazon to replace a very expensive kodak i have been using for about 7 years, hoping with technology there would be even a better pic and things you can do with the camera. I have had this new ge camera for about 3 months and have used it on several events and it took awsome pics and really good vidio. now after 3 months i was going to use it for my oldest sons wedding and the camera keeps freezing up like a computer with a virus, it would take 2 pics then freeze up for about 10 min. I will never be able to replace the pics i missed on my sons wedding because the camera fried after only 3 months. My son is a navy doc. and my new daughter is a navy corman/nurse/ they were in there dress whites and travelled from the other side of the worl for this event and now the majotity of the memories for myself are only in memories not pics. very unsatisfied and unsatisfied with amazon for not lettinf me return this product for a refund
