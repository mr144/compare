I have used digital cameras a great deal (about 60-100 pics per day) for my profession.  This is absolutely the worst camera I have purchased to date.  Macro is virtually non-existant and the camera tends to focus and then go out of focus and soon as you press the button to actually take the photo.  (yes I tried all the various settings)
