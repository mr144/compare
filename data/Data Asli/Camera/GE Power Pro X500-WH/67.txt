I considered buying the Nikon that same day and regret not choosing it over this GE.  There is a problem with the auto focus.  By the time you take the picture after the auto focus zooms in and out the subject is changed.  When using it for still photos, the photo always comes out blurry no matter how you try to adjust the settings.  The settings are burdensome to adjust in most settings.  The only good photos are taken in daylight or outside.  I cannot recommend this camera.
