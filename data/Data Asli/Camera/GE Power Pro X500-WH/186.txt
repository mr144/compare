January I bought my brother this camera for his birthday and was impressed with the all around quality and design. I needed a camera that was automated and could shoot good photos so I bought myself the same camera in white and am super satisfied. I went for the extra few bucks and bought the promotion deal with the bag and smart card.  Everyone thinks the camera cost a lot more money.  It has all the important features yet still is not a battery hog.  I would recomend this camera to everyone.
