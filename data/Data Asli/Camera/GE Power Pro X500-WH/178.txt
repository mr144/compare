I researched cameras on here before ordering this, and I bought this one based on the price and it seemed to have a lot of 5 star reviews. I bought the white one and I LOVE how it looks and it works even better. This is my first camera that is a little more than just a point_and_shoot, and while its very easy to use it does have so many settings and effects that make it what I guess you did call a bridge-camera. Basically I am obsessed with it, the quality of the pictures is great, the price is unheard of, and the camera works well for taking pictures for my college newspaper.
