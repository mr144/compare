This camera took me a while to learn it since I had a Sony Camera prior to this.  Now, I love this little camera.  Takes fantastic pictures, lightweight, easy to carry with you and always ready to go..(rechargeable batteries).  I love the 15-X Zoom, and the color clarity is absolutely beautiful.  What a great camera for the price.  I paid twice as much for my Sony, and this camera does the exact same thing.  Love, love, loveit.Jan B.
