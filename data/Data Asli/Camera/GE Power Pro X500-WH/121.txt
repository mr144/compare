I bought this camera back in August and have been using since then, it takes excellent pictures, is easy to use, and a great value for the money. On disposable batteries I only got about 30 photos, but on rechargeable batteries I have yet to have it die on me with having taken 200 photos in one day. Worth it alone for not having to carry around extra batteries.This camera is worth the price, I almost think its priced too low...lol
