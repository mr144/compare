I have always been a good amateur photographer,  and I owned many cameras from professional Reflex with interchangeable lenses to small fast ones, all makes Canon, Nikon, Sony etc.I received this order 2 days before expected ( Thank you Amazon) in perfect condition,I was not really convinced it would be a good camera and mostly I bought it for the 15x optical, very difficult to find in a low priced camera. I started using it, and not only the quality of the picture is good, but focus is excellent also, the antishake is excellent. Has a very nice set of programs more than enough for an amateur. And the features are more than enough.Bottom Line, do not expect anything better at this price, and not even double.Thank you
