I wanted a good quality camera without the huge price tag. I am a amateur when it comes to taking pictures but after taking it to a local photographer, I have become more comfortable using this camera. Plus I love the zoom capability on this baby! I can get shots of my little darling when she is performing on stage and I do not have to be &#34;that&#34; person walking down in front of everyone! Awesome! Could not be happier. Ecstatic about this purchase. Would definitely recommend!
