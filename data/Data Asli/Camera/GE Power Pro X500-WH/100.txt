I do not have such a detailed review as the others do, but I can tell you this much. This camera is absolutely amazing ! I know nothing at all about cameras other than turn it on, zoom it if needed, click and shoot but this camera is literally ' me ' proof! I have had it about a year now, and I could not be happier and I have a lot of friends with 600.00 or more cameras and they love mine. You can not beat the 'feel'. It feels sturdy, strong and not flimsy at all. It's easy to hold and shoot one handed and the digital display that can come on every time you power up, to let you choose what type of picture you are taking, is ingenious! I love, love, love this thing and can not recommend it enough.
