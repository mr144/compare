Nice little camera, good bridge from some of the simpler models used alot.  Takes nice, clean pictures, has decent zoom capabilities, and using AA batteries not nearly as bad as some people make out.  I have had same batteries in for over a month and I use the camera on a fairly regular basis.  Overall, for the price, very compareable to some of the pricier models.
