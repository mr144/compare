I have to say that this product exceeded all my expectations with regard to a digital camera.  I have only ever used an analog 35mm camera.  This was my first experience with a digital camera device.  The photo quality was every bit as good as what I am used to with 35mm camera, if not better.  The zoom lens feature is out of this world.  I could not have been happier with the crystal clear photos using the zoom feature.  I have posted examples of these photos on my Facebook page if anyone would like to view them:  Jim DeWilde/ Lapeer, MI, Yellowstone 2012, final edit.  Again, I cannot say enough about the excellent quality of this digital camera.
