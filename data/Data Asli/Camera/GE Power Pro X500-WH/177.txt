I am not a professional photographer.I really like this camera.The zoom is amazing ! it is a little big but I guess they were going for the pro camera look.If you take pictures right after another they are blurry and or the camera pauses or gets kind of frozen.The video picture is excellent but the sound stink's you cant hear anything but Muffled noise.The picture quality is fine.I am happy enough with the camera and the price is what really sold me.
