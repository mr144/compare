I was really skeptical about a camera this cheap but I was pleasantly surprised at how great it is. It has a lot of fun little features that make it a good bridge camera. Currently the panorama option is my favorite, but as spring rolls around, I am sure that will change. Picture quality is very good-not quite DSLR quality BUT it is not a DSLR so it is not to be expected. A few cons (minor inconveniences more than anything) It kills batteries. I have taken to bringing a second set of batteries with me anytime I am going to take more than ten or fifteen pictures-it is to be expected as it takes a lot of power to take such large pictures. The flash is puny for indoor pics, extra light is a good thing. One hint-attach your lens cap to your neck strap or you'll lose it.Overall this is a really good camera for someone who is beyond point and click but is not quite ready to invest the money or time that a DSLR camera requires.
