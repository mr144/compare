I got this camera in Sep.2007, as a trade-in for my Canon Digital Rebel 8mp, which I had for two years.I was not very happy with Canon, although I have two powershots, which are excellent(A80,95)But Rebel was not.I explored at least 10 reviews on K20D, and all without exception were outstanding.Indeed, the camera is the best I had since Nikon F90X which I purchased in 1996, just at the beginning of the digital revolution.Most people are absolutely brainwashed by the media biased towards Pentax. Nikon and Canon invest astronomical amounts of money to advertise and buy the media.It's simply brainwashing.Pentax is THE BEST camera for the money you can buy.Pentax is also feature rich camera, produces stunning images without the need to photoshop at all.Highly highly reccomend!
