I have had mine for about a month now, and I am very pleased.  This is my first DSLR - this has restored my passion for photography that I had years ago with my old SLR's.  I bought the Pentax both because I have some older Pentax lenses and because it seemed like the best value for the money.  I am learning the idiosyncrasies of the camera, one being that auto white balance works poorly with my external flash - but choosing the flash white balance setting works beautifully.  I am taking most pictures in RAW+ mode now so I can modify them as needed, but have ready JPEGs to upload to my web site if they do not need any fixing up.  This works well with the 8GB memory cards I am using.  I am having a lot of fun, learning a lot, and wishing I had lots more money to spend on lenses and other accessories, but the kit lens that came with it seems to be a pretty good one for the money.
