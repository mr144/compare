I have had the k20 now for 2 months after getting my k10 stolen in South America, and i am totally stoked. I was shooting a riot a few days ago and got maced in the face by a cop while taking pictures, and the camera was totally fine even after being soaked in the stuff. (Cops do not like when you take pictures of them being mean to others.) The housing is awesome and more or less water (mace) restistant. The k10 handled the jungle with pleasure and i am sure this baby will too. Liveview is pretty lame no matter what camera its on, so thats not an issue for me, except sometimes when using a tripod and remote, in which case liveview performs ok. I shoot everything in raw, so i do not bother with the jpeg funkiness. so if you do not have a trustfund, or somebody else to pay for your gear, this is the one you want. i can not believe what canikonians pay for decent lenses?!!' and yes the 2.8 optics are heaven. All i can say to canikonians is NAH NAH NAH na na NAH!!! sucks for you. ;)peace love and happiness!
