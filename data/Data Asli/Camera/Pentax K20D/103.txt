If IQ is the most important aspect for you then K20D is definitely for you. K20D by far has the best image quality in APS-C format, period.I have compared it with Nikon's D300 & Canon's 40D and the K20D has the smoothest yet sharpest image. This is what 'IMAGE QUALITY REVOLUTION' that should have been when Pentax introduced K10D back in November 2006.You can see every bit of texture with K20D and the colors are just perfect for landscapes and portraits.The most improved points from K10D are auto white balance, auto focus speed and auto focus accuracy.The only complaint I have is that the shutter sound is still a little bit too loud compare to Nikon's and the FPS should have been 5 FPS.Other than that K20D is the best APS-C DSLR camera as of today.-----------------UPDATES---------------After couple months with K20D, I bought another one to replace my K10D. Right now I have 2 K20Ds with DA* 16-50 and DA* 50-135. I like 2 bodies- 2 lenses combo. I do not need to change lenses anymore.AF ADJUSTMENT is a BIG PLUS for K20D. MY DA* 16-50 has FRONT FOCUS issue and my DA* 50-135 has BACK FOCUS issue. Thanks to K20D, now all my pictures are TACKY SHARP. What a life saver...
