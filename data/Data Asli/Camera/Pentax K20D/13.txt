I will be returning this.  The Shake Reduction does not work, in fact, it appears to make some pictures worse and definitely makes the camera run a little  slower.  I tested extensively including a Tamron 18-200mm set at 200mm, f6.7, 1/15s.  In all my tests the pictures with the Shake Reduction on were either the same or worse than with the Shake Reduction set to off.  This is very disappointing.  This is the reason I bought this camera and not the D90 or the XSi.  I wanted to use a 18-200mm with Shake Reduction (Nikon charges $800 for the lense alone in this scenario).  I spent a long time on this expensive decision and I am very disappointed.  I hope for other Pentax owners that this is an isolated example.
