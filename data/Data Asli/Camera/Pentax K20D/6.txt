All the reviews I have read echo my positive feelings.  Besides the fact that I had a Pentax film-type camera way back in the Disco era, when shopping for a camera in 2007, I was immediately sold on the idea that the Pentax (K10 et al) puts the image stabilization in the BODY OF THE CAMERA.  In other words, you do not have to pay for Image Stabilization in every lens you buy!  What does that save?  $50 PER LENS?!  That's what I call the Pentax advantage.  I knew even before buying the camera, that I did want a collection of lenses before long.  Pick up Canon or Nikon in the same price range, and it is just a bunch of PLASTIC!  I take my wildflower pictures in DNG format, and I could not be more pleased with the quality, in whatever terms you prefer: sharpness, detail, contrast, bits per color,  depth of field or the bokeh of a Macro lens (depending on the lens).I would put this camera against anything else on the market with the same number of pixels.
