I continued my travels through the Pentax family since I learned to shoot with the old K1000 and all my lenses were bought for this camera, I just hated the idea of starting over from scratch.  I upgraded to the MZS several years ago but finally made the leap to digital with the K20d this spring after missing graduation pictures of a niece due to rewinding film.  I have absolutely loved the in camera shake reduction.  My general use lense is a Sigma 28-300.  I was shooting a pickup basketball game at our church this weekend at around 200 handheld in shutter speed priority and getting excellent shots.  I have used all the modes at some point in the past six weeks or so and they all work wonderfully well though I can not imagine when ISO priority will actually be my main consideration in a shoot.  I have only had one complaint and that came shooting lightning shots at night.  The camera takes about 80% as long to write the information to the card as the aperature was left open.  I have done some research and have learned that card speed might be a factor so I have some 30m cards coming,... I'll update if these improve this weakness.  The data capture with each shot will be helpful in learning becuase this camera tracks everything but moon phase and wind speed involved with taking the shot.  It can only greatly improve the leaning curve.
