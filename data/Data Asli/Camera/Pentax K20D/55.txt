I did not purchase my Pentax K20D at Amazon but I can tell you that this reduced price is amazing. The camera is well worth it at the original price! I am an amateur photographer but it gives me some incredible shots - and actually helps me learn so much more than my SLR or a regular digital zoom camera. Play around with the settings, take a photo and instantly see how it turned out. It's easy enough for a beginner like me and complicated enough that I will have a lot of features and settings to look forward to experimenting with for a long time.The first national photography contest I entered a photo taken with this camera in - was published!

If I can take photos like this with my very limited knowledge and experience, you will love it!
