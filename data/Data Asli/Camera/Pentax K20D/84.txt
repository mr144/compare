Since my day-to-day camera is a Pentax K10D, I was curious how the K20D would compare. I expected the camera to perform better than the K10D and prove to be a worthwhile upgrade. What I discovered was that the K20D is an amazing camera in much the same way as the older K10D. In short, while it is a very good camera, it might not be a worthwhile upgrade for current K10D owners.Focus speed of the K20D is about the same as the K10D, just a little quieter. The 3 fps continuous shooting performance is nice, but the similarly speced Canon 40D and Nikon D300 have much faster continuous shooting performance. Also, the fact that you can no longer shoot JPEGs at 3fps until the card fills up was a disappointment.Image quality is among the best I have seen in the sub $2,000 price range but the ISO noise was only marginally improved over the older K10D. The full compatibility with every Pentax lens means almost limitless options for expansion and growth of your photographic skills. Colors are rich even at the 'natural' image tone setting. In-camera shake reduction and dust removal means that this mid-level camera is remarkably full-featured. Thanks to the intuitive control layout, any serious photographer will feel right at home.Bottom line: if you do not already own a K10D, at the $1,299 (and lower) price point the K20D may be the best value on the market.
