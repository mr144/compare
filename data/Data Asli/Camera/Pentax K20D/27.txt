I have  had  my  K20D  since  December  2008  and  have shot  about 3000 images.  This  is a wonderful  camera - solid  build,  set up  and  adjustments  easy  to do on the fly  thanks  to  the  quick  access  controls.  I  am also  particularly  impressed  with the  night  time images  it  takes.The battery  life  is  outstanding  as  well.  From a single  charge,  I  can  do  a  full  8GB card at  14MP  per  image.
