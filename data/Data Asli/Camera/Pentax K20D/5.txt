Have owned for over a year now - and am using it to shoot fine art photography.  Have enlarged prints to 16x20 with absolutely no problems whatever.  The camera has many features of cameras costing much more.  It also shoots in RAW with ISO's from 100 to 6400 which I used inside very dark cathedrals in Portugal.  Am using Tamron lenses and the combination is very good.  Just received (from Santa) the cable remote release.  I also have the battery pack and strobe.  I use batteries that have 2,000 mAH - and with the battery pack, I am able to shoot many (read over 400+) shots before the battery in the pack goes and then I have the one inside the camera.  I would strongly recomment using the battery pack if you are doing a large shoot.  So far, I am well pleased with the camera and lens combination.
