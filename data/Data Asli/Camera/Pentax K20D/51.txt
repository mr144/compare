Recieved my new K20D a few days back. as  the camera moved in my hands i could hear something shaking inside.i asked Amazon to replace it, they did it very fast, and the next one has the same problem.i wonder: all K20D are like that?mine was assembled in the Philippines.your comments, please. thanks.
