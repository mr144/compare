I have been a serious Pentax photographer for over 20 years... so naturally, because of my investment in PK type lenses, I purchased one of the first K20D's as soon as it was available.I should have waited!Please understand, there is a reason for all these great reviews. It really is a good camera in many respects. However, if you have special requirements, such as long exposures (e.g. astrophotography), this is NOT the camera to purchase.The K20D uses a new and jointly developed Samsung CMOS imager. Unfortunately, they have not worked out all the kinks... um... namely heat! As a result, the K20D produces a significant amount of noise (hot pixels) and this is why the K20D is the *ONLY* current DSLR camera that forces the user to endure an automatic DFS (Dark Frame Subtraction) for any length of exposure in Bulb mode (or any manual/automatic exposure greater than 15 seconds). This means that a 2 minute exposure is actually 4 minutes, a 30 minute exposure will take 1 hour, and so on...If money is no object, consider Canon or Nikon. Canon is especially prized by astrophotographers as being the best DSLR for long exposures.The other annoying problem is that the K20D is terribly slow (and even worse in low light) with auto focus! Again, Canon and Nikon do a much better job.Other than two major complaints.... I echo the positive attributes spoken by others about this camera.The K20D loses two stars (out of five) because of the forced DFS and high noise levels. Pentax almost made the perfect camera!
