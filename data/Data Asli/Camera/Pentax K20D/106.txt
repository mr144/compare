I researched all the latest and greatest DSLR and this Pentax K20 kept coming up as a big recommendation.  The features on this K20 are really fantastic and not found on the usual suspects of the Cannons or D40/D80.  If your starting out into the DSLR world do not be afraid of this camera.  You can make it as automatic or customizable as you want and the pictures are just the best I have ever seen.  I recommend buying the 8GB SDHC card because the 14.6MP really takes up the space.  I also got the Pentax 18-250mm lense and it is really such a great all around lense.  If you are not tied to a particular brand because of previously purchased lenses then I highly recommend this camera.  You will not be disappointed!
