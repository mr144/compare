Owning several film cameras from Pentax I discovered the LX years ago. An under-rated but super machine, which I still own.After reading some reviews of the K20D I wanted to try one out. Although I live near Baltimore, upper quality cameras by Pentax are difficult to find.Trying to locate the best price from a dealer with good reputation, I discovered Amazon.There are many things about the K20 I like and some things I wish were different.The menu is repetitive. and the instruction booklet like a King novel. I do not care for the LCD, but can not say why exactly. It should have a higher shutter speed than 1/4000th and the processsor could be 14 bit as opposed to 12 bit.It has a great 'feel' in one's hand and this is improved by the grip. Looking over how the camera is made brings confidence, in the same way the LX did. Any lens with the p/k mount will work. The in camera processing is to be commended as well.The lens system for Pentax has never seemed as extensive as others, but the quality for the better lenes is there and why have so many choices that are close to each other. How many does one truly need or can carry.Speaking to dealers about Pentax, most caused me to feel like a renegade for not choosing Canon or Nikon. I have other cameras, and if the 20 is half the camera the LX has been, I'll be a happy camper!
