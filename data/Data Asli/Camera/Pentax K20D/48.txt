I have a long history with Pentax and my expectations were satisfied and then some.  While there is a bit of a learning curve to this camera, once you have even the basics down this camera performs marvelously.  The gimmick features are fine enough, but for me it is the quality of the pictures that counts.  That is after what I bought the camera for.  They are clear and crisp with excellent color rendition.  The fact that I can drag out my Pentax 500mm 4.5 lens and use it again makes the legacy lensing of both my 35mm and 6x7 once again useful.  This is a camera for photographers, especially for those who still shoot as though they were using film.  You can control your shots precisely as far as exposure is concerned, and require very little in the way of software correction.  I especially like the infrared mode of the black and white area.  All in all this camera will do what you want for a much more affordable price than it is competitors.
