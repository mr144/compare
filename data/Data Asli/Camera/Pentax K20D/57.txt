Pentax k20D is a good upgrade form Pentax k10D. Camera comes with a stabilized 14.6 megapixel CMOS image sensor, high quality image processing, dust- and weather-proof seals, 11-point AF, and more custom features than any photographer would need. Good image quality, low noise, excellent build quality. Nikon D300 is faster, but much more expensive.
