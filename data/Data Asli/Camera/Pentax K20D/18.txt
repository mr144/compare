On a price/value basis the K20D is a digital camera buy. But, I have not had the time to give the camera a rigorous work out. So who knows, I might move the stars up or down as time goes on.  Make no mistake, the camera is a big hand full of features. More than the casual photographer needs. On a cursory basis, I will say that this is the best Pentax digital camera that I have owned (5) and that it promises a lot. I  have used and owned at least a dozen mechanical/optical Pentax cameras over a 50 year span. I hope the manufacturer does not lose his way in the future.
