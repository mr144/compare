The quality of photos and ease of use is great. BUT!I usually do not consider this a factor in buying a camera but I will from now on: my camera broke and the only way to get it fixed is to have it shipped to the Pentax facility in Arizona. The downtime I found to be highly detrimental to enjoying this purchase. Annoying does not come close to describing the feeling.This factor made it less competitive to comparable brands.Living in a city with a large variety of camera repair shops made this even more frustrating. None of them are authorized to handle this camera.Unless they change this policy, I will never buy another Pentax for this reason.
