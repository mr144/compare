I have been using this camera for several weeks now and I have found the camera to be outstanding. In many ways the camera keeps surprising me with its flexibility and with the resulting image quality. There is only one complaint that I have and that is that all of the information available through the viewer is not also available on the LCD. This is only a minor annoyance. On the other hand many other capabilities keep surprising me. Although the learning curve of this camera [and other cameras of this type] is clearly steeper than a 'point & shoot', the flexibility is very much appreciated. [Let me note that 'point & shoot' is also an option with this camera, but I usually use the manual modes except when shooting outdoor scenery.] Part of my positive reaction is probably also due to the excellent 18-250 mm ~14x zoom lens that I bought with the camera. This lens takes you all the way from moderate wide angle to long telephoto. This camera does not use a full 35 mm detector but uses a 'C type' cmos processor which is approximately 25 x 16 mm and all lens focal lengths should be multiplied by 1.5x to determine the 35 mm equivalent, therefore this lens, combined with this camera, produces an effective focal length of 27-375 mm. The positive of this is that the resulting lenses can be MUCH smaller than for a full 35 mm SLR. One of the really pleasing characteristics is the ability of this camera to take high quality images at high equivalent asa ratings up to 800 asa and with tolerable noise levels at even 1600 or, in a pinch, 3200 asa. This is important to me since I almost never use a flash. Finally, note that the 'body only' antishake enables this camera body to use most older model Pentax lenses.
