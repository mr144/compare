I came from Nikon, which does offer great products. I am now however, a full-fledged Pentax evangelist. I can not say enough about their products. I now own a K20D and two lenses: the DA* 16-50 f/2.8 and the DA* 50-135 f/2.8. The combination of these two lenses and the K20D offers some of the best semi-pro quality available for the money.There are 4 main features that made me buy this camera:1) Price. Hands down, it is in my opinion, the most value for your money.2) Weather proofing. 72 weather proofing seals on the camera body and coatings on their DA series lenses make this camera ideal for travel.3) Top-side LCD panel. This is a must-have feature for anyone serious about photography.4) Front AND Rear dials. This allows for quick modifications of various camera settings and are customizable for each exposure mode.Regarding image quality - the camera is somewhat important as we are now dealing with sensors instead of film, but the glass (lenses) are without a doubt the most important element of the equation. So - that said, you should seriously consider replacing the kit lens with a DA* or Limited series lens as soon as possible. The kit lens is very good (compared especially to competitor kit lenses). However, the DA* lenses are phenomenal.Regarding comfort - the camera is very comfortable to hold. I have trouble putting it down. It literally goes everywhere with me.Buy it. Do not hesitate. You will not regret it.
