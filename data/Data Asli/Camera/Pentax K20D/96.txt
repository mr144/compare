I highly recommend this camera. After a year with the K10D, I recently upgraded to the K20D. The K10D was fabulous and I loved it. But I really wanted the LiveView mode and the higher resolution of the K20D. I was disappointed with LiveView though. It is mostly useless. It is nothing like a typical LiveView on most new compact digital cameras. On the K20D, you flip a lever to activate it, at which point auto-focus no longer works (without pressing the AF button and waiting several seconds while the screen goes black and it refocuses... on 'something'). You can manually focus, but that can be a challenge based on the LiveView screen, especially in bright light (and the viewfinder is blank when LiveView is active). After taking a shot, there is a several second 'blackout' period where the screen goes black. This is the #1 annoyance in my opinion, and it is the main reason I never use it. You can continue shooting while it is black, but you will not really know what you are shooting. So my use of LiveView is limited to the occasional self-portrait shot where I need to set the camera on the ground. It is sometimes 'slightly' useful to frame a shot in that situation. (A flip-out screen would make it much more useful.) So aside from my complaints about LiveView, I do love everything else about this camera. The higher resolution and better quality image sensor is definitely an improvement over the K10D. At the highest resolution, pictures are much larger, of course. (I shoot in RAW, so I bought a 16GB SDHC card, which holds about 600 RAW images.) There are a few other 'cool' new features (like a 21 fps low-res shooting mode), but I really have not found any practical use for them. The picture processing engine on this K20D is faster than the K10D. In summary, if you want the higher resolution, buy the K20D. If 10MP is enough for you and you do not care about novelty features, buy the K10D. But you will be happy with either of these great new Pentax cameras. For the next model, I am hoping for  areal' always-on LiveView and a flip-out screen!
