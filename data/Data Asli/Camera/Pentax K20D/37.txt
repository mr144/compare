I can only agree with the positive reviews in this discussion forum. The price, under $700, is amazing for a camera of this excellence. When the price was reduced recently to $669. I decided it was worth the investment to buy a second body-only K20D, and I am glad I did. The learning curve is 'kinda' steep for a digital newbie like me, but the info I need is in the manual, of course.With two cameras, I do not worry about the battery losing power, because one camera is always at the ready. I use a zoom lens in one camera and a prime lens in the other. These days my main focus, no pun intended, is photos of family pets. Adding to our household's menagerie of five indoor cats, most of which had been abandoned, we recently adopted two heretofore abandoned dogs. The photos of these pets are beautiful, especially so when the photos are enlarged to 8 x 10, and no red eye at all, even with the use of simple auto focus.
