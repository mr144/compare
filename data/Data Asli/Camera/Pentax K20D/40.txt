The K20D is a very worthwhile upgrade over the K10D:- higher ISO (ISO 6400) sensor with more megapixels (15MP)- retains weatherproof body- Live View (not that mature, but better than nothing!)- In-Body Anti-Shake- better AF- better Auto White Balance- micro AF adjustThe Pentax K20D is not the best at everything:- no video mode like the Canon EOS 500D- Live View is 1st generation (somewhat like Canon EOS 40D class)- EOS 50D has better high-ISO noise- gritty screen compared to the full-VGA screen on the EOS 500D / 50D / 5D Mk II- slower AF than the Canon and Nikon competitors (even the entry-level ones)However, the K20D- retains compatibility with the 20-million plus old Pentax lenses out there- has in-body image stabilization- is weather sealed- has micro AF adjust for up to 20 lenses (just like the Canon EOS 50D and higher)So while it may not win on a point-per-point basis, it wins on the total package. And if you check the price of the EOS 50D, it is obvious that the K20D is a solid value winner. Right now at under $700 this mid-range DSLR body costs less than the newly-announced, entry-level Canon EOS 500D.When we are comparing Pentax's flagship DSLR to Canon's entry-level DSLR on price, that's really  saying something.
