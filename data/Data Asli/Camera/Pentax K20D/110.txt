This is a great camera. The CMOS sensor produces rich images with very little noise. I expected much more noise with the change from CCD to CMOS. I shoot in mostly in DNG format and had to get get larger SDHD cards. An 8 gig card will hold 333 DNG images. The K20D has many new features, such as wireless flash control, dust alert, live view, ect.
