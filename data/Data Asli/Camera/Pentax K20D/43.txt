As a Pentaxian (Pentax lover), I have only used Pentax cameras.  My last DSLR was the *ist DL and I thought Pentax could not top that camera until I tried out this model.  This is by far the best I have used, all the controls are easily accessible.  The 14.9 MP gives truly sharp pictures.  They are easy to edit, both on my computer or in the camera.  With the SDHC memory card, it can use just about any size, I have a 16GB in it and I know I'll never run out of space.  I highly recommend this camera to the serious photographer or for any photographer wanting to take their picture taking abilites to the next level.  Even though I have never used any other brand, I dide match any of my Pentax cameras against any other brands out there.
