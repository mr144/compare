I recently bought this unit. My previous camera was a Canon Digital Rebel Xti. Honestly it took some time to get used to the controls. But now I am used to it and it feels perfect. The colors and the image quality are top notch. In-Body SR performs very well and the image viewfinder is huge.The things that take time to get used to are:1-The parameters are not displayed on main LCD. They can be seen through viewfinder and top/small LCD. But main LCD stays dark. You can review the parameters by pressing the info button, but when you change any parameter, the screen turns off.2-The dial to switch between spot metering and area metering is too close to mode dial. Sometimes you involuntarily change the mode without noticing.3-The metering is a little bit dark. Some + metering is needed to get some shots.Once you get used to it, it performs incredibly well. When I switched from Canon to Pentax, my friends were asking me why. After seeing the shots, they agree that it was a wise choice.
