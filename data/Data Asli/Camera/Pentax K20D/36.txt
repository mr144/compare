I remembered when I was first thinking of buying this camera, the reviews where 67 at five stars and now 81 at five stars. This will only keep climbing. This camera is the real deal. I could have bought the D90 or the 50D but all my research landed me here and I am so glad. I am not going to run on and on, but this is one awesome camera. The feel of this camera is great and the image quality is unreal. I highly recommend the DA* 16-50mm lens.
