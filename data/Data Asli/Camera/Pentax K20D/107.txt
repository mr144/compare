I was really excited about the potential of this camera; the picture quality was outstanding, the ergonomics were perfect, I have some really good glass for it, but there was a recurring problem with the files that I downloaded to Lightroom, both in DNG and in Pentax mode.  There was always a black band along the right side.  I called Pentax and the tech said I had to use Pentax software, which I could have used and then exported to Lightroom.  I just do not think I should have to go that extra step.  I do not have to do it with my K100D, so what is going on?  Anyway, I have tried 2 different K20 cameras and they both did the same thing.  I have not been able to find any reference to this problem on the Pentax forum, or any other reveiw of the K20.  I hope someone can figure this out so I can resume my K20 habit.
