The Pentax  K20D is an excellent camera--it is what the K10D should have been. The Amazon free shipping service was just as good as paying for UPS shipping--it arrived in only four days. The carrier was supposed to get a signature but did not--the package was left at the (house) doorstep (a consideration if one lives in a building where theft is possible).I will certainly consider Amazon for future electronic/optical purchases.
