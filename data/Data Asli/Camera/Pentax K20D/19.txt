This camera is solid.  I did say it is the most comfortable camera I have ever held in my hands.  It has amazing capabilities but to be sure, the learning curve is quite steep.  As others have mentioned, focus is a bit slow as well as capture rate.  If you shoot action, look elsewhere.  If however your subjects are more static, this camera will impress.  The bad: If you are on a Mac, plan on budgeting for a proper photo editing program.  The included software simply will not work at all.  It appears to be a longstanding problem from what I have gathered surfing the net.  SilkyPix is definitely not for Mac owners.  I did give it a 5 star rating if not for the horrible software package.
