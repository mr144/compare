I have owned a Pentax K-1000 in the past but did not know what to expect from them when it came to digital images.  I recently received my camera and began to take experimental pics from around the house.  Each time the picture came out extremely clear with excellent image form and detail. The images required just minor enhancements with photo shopping software and they were good to go.  I was surprised that the flash images worked out so well (up to a point).  The rechargeable battery is incredible and lasts for a long, long time.  I have had the camera for about two weeks and have only charged it once and have taken hundreds of pictures both with and without the flash.I took the camera with me to Wyoming and captured some of the most incredible images I have every shot.  The details just jump off of the image.  The 14mp file (actually around 12mp)allows me to crop and size without loosing details.  Ca not wait to use it to collect aerial images.
