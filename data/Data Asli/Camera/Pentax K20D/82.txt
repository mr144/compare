I bought the camera because of many 'neat feature' points.1) in-camera stabilization2) 14 megapixel resolution3) dust locator and auto cleaner4) multi-image capture on same frame5) etc, etc, etc (read the other reviews, I will not get into all of them here)But what I have not liked so far is the grip. The camera's grip seems to be missing about 1/2 inch of circumference. My hands are fairly small, and I still think this is true. My previous Pentax PZ1-p had a fantastic grip, comfortable, and felt steady. I feel like this is going to fall out of my hands, because the grip is missing a little substance. My Canon 20D also had a great feeling grip. I bought the battery grip BG2, based on reviews that said 'It was made for the k20D', and 'it completes the camera,' and other such comments. But the fact is, it makes it only a little better, it does not really  amake the camera'
