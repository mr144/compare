I recently bought the Pentax K20d.  I had a previous Pentax set up from the good old days of film.  Was very pleased to learn that I could still use my old lenses (4 pentax lenses worth about $2k of very good quality) with the new camera body.  Additionally I decided to get a new lens to add to my bevy, and not one of the 'throw away' lenses that comes stock with the camera (though I have to say, I was pretty impressed with Pentax's 16mm-45mm f4 option).  But instead, I did the right thing.  I purchased the camera body only and purchased separately the Pentax 16mm-50mm f2.8 lens.  This is the way to go I tell you, it is a few extra bucks to purchase this lens but well worth the money (okay maybe a bit more than a few extra bucks but compared to the price of a Nikon D90 with a throw away lens, this was a much better deal).  Between this lens, my old 100mm f2.8 and my 70mm-200mm f4-5.6, there is no looking back.  Just as a lark, I tried out my old 50mm non-auto focusing lens from my Pentax ME Super, it worked great.  My recommendation, forget the Canon, forget the Nikon, get the Pentax and get the right lens, you will not regret it.
