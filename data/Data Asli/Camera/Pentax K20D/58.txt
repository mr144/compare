This camera is just amazing, it has no equal in it is price range. The clarity of the pictures captured with just a kit lens is astounding. It is certainly the closest to a pro model that most photo enthusiasts will afford. The only complaint I could have is Pentax's decision to hold on to the P-TTL flash system. It limits the selection of external flashes and I am not convinced on it is performance. Other than that I think the many pro features, the amazing construction and the amazing ability to capture strikingly sharp detail makes up for it is P-TTL downfall. I am not easily satisfied with cameras and I love this thing!
