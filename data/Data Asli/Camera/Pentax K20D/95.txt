I have been a photographer for twenty-five years or so, and eight years of that I was a pro. I have owned Hasselblads and Canons and Nikons and Linhofs. I have owned pentax in the past and loved them. This camera continues the tradition, offering more for your money - more quality than comparably priced cameras, more pixels, more features - you name it. It's priced like an enthusiast camera with enough 'pro' features to deserve the appellation. It's no EOS 1Ds MKIII, but the full size image is breathtaking. There's resolution to spare, and the shake reduction works miracles for me. I have a handheld image shot at 1/4 sec that's sharp at 100% crop!And the ease with which you can use the old lenses is just ridiculous. Throw even an old Pentax-M lens on it, set the camera to manual, set your aperture, touch the 'Green Button', and the camera sets the programmed exposure - you can adjust from there to your heart's content. You can even specify the kind of program used by the green button - optimized for fast shutter speeds or depth of field - or the sharpest  resolution settings of the appropriate lens. You can pick up used Pentax lenses all over for next to nothing, excellent glass on par with any manufacturer. Pentax glass is known for its color saturation and contrast, and this camera shows it off.I do not want to just repeat what's already been said, but I also have to say - this is a photographer's camera. It does everything you did want a camera to do, and then some. The 'Hyper Program' is unbelievably cool - you touch the shutter, it sets the exposure, then you roll dials to adjust from there. Absolutely transparent. You can customize the functions of the wheels to a ridiculously convenient level - this can be any camera you want it to be. All in all, this is a real jewel, and the king of bang-for-the-buck.
