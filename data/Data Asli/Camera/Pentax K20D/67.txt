This a very preliminary review because I have not had the camera long enough to put it through its paces, but one thing is immediately obvious to anyone familiar with the K10D: the new processing 'engine' in the K20D produces vastly superior color to that of the K10D.  I had the 1st*DL, with which Pentax simply outclassed the competition in the category of 'cameras with truly stupid names.'  Then came the K10D which is a better camera in several respects, including having 10.2 mp compared with 6.0 mp.  The K20D is extremely similar to its predecessor, albeit with a larger LCD screen, but the big difference is on the inside.A NOTE ABOUT LENSES.  Putting a less than superb lens on a camera of this quality is akin to putting cheap gas in Ferrari.  Although Pentax justifiably emphasize that you can use any Pentax lens with its DSLRs, the ideal lenses are the latest generation, designed specifically for this size sensor.  Within the family of Pentax lenses for their DSLRs, some are much better lenses than others.  I have the f/1.4 50mm lens, which is superb, and a bargain as well.  The 16-45mm zoom is said to be outstanding.  The 'kit' lenses offered with the body as a 'kit' are usually the 18-50 and 50-200 zooms.  Neither of these is of the same quality as the lenses I just mentioned.  The 50 mm can be found for about $200 (which is astonishing for a f/1.4 lens of this quality) and the 16-45 for $275, also a bargain.
