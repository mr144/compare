I am very impressed with this camera, I bought as an upgrade to to my Pentax *stD.While ordering it I took a leap of faith and ordered the 'openbox' from Amazon market place, thinking that if I do not like it, I could always return, but to my surprise, the only thing dented was the package it came in. The camera body was perfectly new, no blemishes, I popped in my 18-250mm lens and the photo quality has been a dream. I like that i can have both jpg and RAW in one shot.I recommend this camera to pple who are watching their budget and also want high quality camera. If you have not yet invested in lenses for other expensive competitions in the market, you will not be disappointed with Pentax K20.
