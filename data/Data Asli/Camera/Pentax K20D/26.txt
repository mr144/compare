Coming from the K100DS, the K20d is a vast improvement.  The overall speed, responsiveness and quality are very good.  Unfortunately the K20 suffers from the digital age.  Pixel peeping, (which is the equivalent to looking at a Rembrandt or a Picasso with a magnifying glass)  forums, internet reviews have put more weight on this and all cameras than they deserve. In reality all cameras are just tools.  Having to work around the quarks and shortcomings of the K100DS I have learned to work with the Pentax system.  No Pentax does not have the worlds fastest AF, but in all honesty sports shooters will tell you they shoot in manual and honestly until the price of the K7 comes down you can live with it or buy a Nikon D3x for $7000.  Yes the meter underexposes, but this is more a thing of understanding when and which (spot, center, multi) meter has this tendency.  The high iso is crap, but so is the high iso on every apc-s sensor.  Some look better than others, but these sensors are not full-frame and they shouldnt as of yet be expected to perform in this way.  This camera cost $650 compared to a D700.  Up to iso 2000 the image is fairly impressive to me.  The ultimate in quality still lays with film especially medium format and large format.Ultimately the K20D is a very impressive tool, but it is just that, a tool for making photographs.  Bells and whistles cost money as can be seen with the K7, which I am sure is a fine camera but for the cost I can pick the K20 and the limited 77mm 1.8 lens.  Ultimately the camera should not take the picture for you, you should use the camera to create. Understand the tool, learn it and take control of it.
