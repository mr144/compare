As a world traveler I wanted a weatherproof, dust resistant Primary DSLR for a reasonable price. This is a discontinued model which received rave reviews and cost 1/3 the price of cameras with similar features. The shake reduction works so well that I can take hand held pictures with a 300mm telephoto.
