I always have positive experience with Pentax Products before the DSLR.  One of the reason I decided on choosing Pentax k20D over other brand is its good reviews everywhere online and the affordable price.  I have never touch a Pentax DSLR before I place the order on Amazon and not even sure where this thing was made (I would like to take the chance to confirm here it was made in Philipine), that explained I have a lot of faith and trust on all the reviews I have read online, and thank you all, the k20D indeed is a great camera.  Due to my past experience with Pentax and being an avid photographer, I find the menu came with the camera quite informing and easy to read.  So far I only have less than 50 shots with the k20D and I should not comment too much on the quality of the pictures this camera produced because I pair it with an old standard Pentax 50mm 1:1.4 lens.  So far with manual setting the picture quality is very good (outdoor and indoor w/o flash).  I took one of the reviewer's advice to set NR to low, and not even care for the camera's default setting.  I also pair the k20D with an old zoom Albinar 85-205 zoom lens, the picture outcome was a joke!  I tried the Albinar's Macro feature outdoor, to my amaze it was quite good!  So I guess I just have to take another reviewer's advice to buy the top-of-the-line Pentax DA* 50-135mm lens to pair with the k20D.  I do not have the money yet, I'll definitely buy one when my tax return arrive.One thing I have to comment on the shipping time from Amazon.  I placed the order of k20D (direct from Amazon) on 3/25 along with the Battery Grip (from Amazon MarketPlace), the Grip arrived way before the camera.  The camera was shipped on 3/30 (took Amazon 5 days to get the order ready!) and arrived at my house on 4/6 by UPS (12 days total).  I had to skip work and wait at home all day for the package, the package arrived at 6:30PM on that day, what a pity!  Yes, it is good to have a day off, but in this recession, I dare not pissing the boss off!PS.  I use a store-brand 8GB Class-6 SDHC card with the k20d, it is flawless, and it only cost me $14.99.
