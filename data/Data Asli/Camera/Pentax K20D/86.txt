This is my first DSLR (though by no means my first digital camera: I have had a Powershot G1, Olympus C8080WZ & a Lumix LX-2). I have been refusing to buy a DSLR mostly because I have been annoyed with Canon & Nikon (they seem mostly to be about defining and farming market niches) and Olympus is not there yet (limitations with Dynamic Range and viewfinder size). I have never owned a Pentax before but the more I read about it, the more I liked it on paper. Now that I have got it, I like it even better. The camera offers tremendous flexibility and control in a very straightforward way. If you are an enthusiastic amateur, want to take beautiful pictures, and do not want to have to spend an arm and a leg to do it, you should absolutely consider buying the K20D.
