The Pentax K20D has exceeded by expectations in every way imaginable.  I upgraded to the K20D after owning a Nikon D40 for about two years.  When I was ready to upgrade I looked at the Nikon D90 and the Canon 40D/50D but in the end, the Pentax K20D offered the best bang for the buck.  The determining factors for me were the in camera shake reduction, the build quality/weather sealing of the camera body, and availability for high quality lenses (DA* series and DA Limited) at a fraction of the cost of similar lenses from Nikon or Canon.  After owning the Pentax for about two months I could not be happier.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a high quality DSLR.
