I received this product extremely fast expecting it take a least a week but arriving in 2 days. It was securely packaged and all required parts were included. I am very happy with the camera, it is my second Pentax DLSR but with many more features and enhancements over the K100D I purchased not more than a year ago. I needed a second camera body but never expected the huge improvements since my last purchase. I also purchased a battery grip and a 50mm normal lens to compliment my zoom lenses so I feel I have every bit the professional setup I wanted. I have never been disappointed with purchases from Amazon.
