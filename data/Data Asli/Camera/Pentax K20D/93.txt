I have been using this camera for nearly three weeks now and it is great!  The camera feels very steady and all of the buttons and knobs are well placed.  the pictures are also very good.  The only issue that I have run into is that the x-sync speed is not as high as I would like.  1/180 max sync speed is not enough to really freeze any high speed motion.  Overall though the camera is excellent and works well, even with the manual 20 year old lenses I am using.  Also the battery life is good I can take more than 800 shots on one charge, without flash.
