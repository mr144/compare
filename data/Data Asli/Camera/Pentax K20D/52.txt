I got into photography through a Pentax SLR kit, and am returning to the Pentax fold after five years in the Canon wasteland.  I could not be happier.  Whether its the supportive and eccentric user community, the forty-plus years of compatible equipment on the market, or the high-quality, affordable lenses, Pentax people simply have more fun.  Do not let your sunken costs deter you from making the switch.  I sold off my Canon gear for about 80% of retail; plenty of people will pay a premium for Canon's middle-tier junk because some Anna Kournikova look-alike told them to.  Now I have a premium camera and pro-level lenses to match, plus weather sealing and a camera body that's built to last.
