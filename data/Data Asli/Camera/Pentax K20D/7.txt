I always did like my Pentax K10,the pictures were beautiful,and I have won awards with it for the last two years. I have been using it for three years now.A wonderful camera!When they came out with the K20 it has a couple of features that I wanted, however at the time I just could not afford it.I had a couple of health problems that I had to take care of first. When I decided to buy the K20 it was out of production so of coarse what less would I do but go straight to Amazon to take a look and I found what I was looking for and at a price I can live with!!This camera takes a higher quality picture than the K10 or my girlfriend Nikon D300!!It is easy to learn the controls and even in auto I get great shots.I have been using it and have taken some pictures that I am going to enlarge and enter in shows here in Illinois.All of my Pentax glass works with this body so I did not need any new stuff at this point. I would give anything to have a Pentax 800mm fast lens,someday!
