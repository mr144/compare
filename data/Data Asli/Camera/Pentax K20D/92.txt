I purchased my K20D a few weeks ago and I am very impressed. There are some minor things like the formating, it is 100 times faster than my K100D, the focus is faster also. I was out yesterday and it started raining and I had the wife cover up the K100D, but I just kept shooting with the K20D. No other company's camera can do or say that. I also love that Pentax can use every lens they ever made, and ebay has become a shopping haven for me.  All I can say Is you will not be dissapointed with the K20D. Just go out and hold one and then hold the competitors and you can feel the better quality of the K20D.
