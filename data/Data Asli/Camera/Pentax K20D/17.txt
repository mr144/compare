I have been taking pictures since 1978. I have used many different camera brands and types, both film and digital. This is my favorite. Pentax did a very good job making the controls user friendly. I was able to figure out 85% of the functions without ever opening the well written manual. That is always a plus in my opinion.The file size is huge. It allows for major cropping. It will work with all of the old manual Pentax lenses as well as the new auto-focus models. For someone like me that has old glass, it will save you a lot of money. The other plus is that there is a lot of high quality glass available on EBay that will work with this camera, if you do not mind using manual exposure. I have taken beautiful pictures using lenses from the late 70's.Overall if you are looking to step up to a DSLR I think it would be hard to beat the K20D. I enjoy using it everyday.Do your part in stimulating the economy. Buy this camera!
