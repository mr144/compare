I am no expert - this is my first DSLR - and I did much of my shopping preparation here on Amazon (great in-depth reviews and suggestions, and so I got this K20D for its sturdiness, retro feel, and features and capacity I can grow into). But when it came time to buy I did a google search and found it way cheaper elsewhere.... Once I did ordered it (at an increased price...) I happened to do a search of that online retailer + 'scam' and found they are one of the many 'bait and switch' dealers out there. So I cancelled that order immediately and returned to amazon.com for the purchase. When it came time to check out, the camera/lens set was maybe a hundred dollars more than the other place, but besides the free shipping, I also was offered $200 in bonus promos (including a 12 megapixel Pentax point and shoot and a camera bag!), and was confident in knowing I was not dealing with sharks. The camera(s) arrived quickly and well packed, and so begins my digital adventure.....My advice is simple, shop and compare and get educated on the camera and lens you want, then buy from Amazon.com (or some similarly reputable source) with confidence.
