You will not find a better camera in terms of image quality unless you are willing to spend $7000+ for a Canon Mark III or a medium format outfit. Just do not tell the guy who just wasted thousands on a ripoff like the D3 ;-).This is THE perfect camera for portraiture, studio still and landscapes on a budget. Make sure you get top (prime) lenses (forget the 18-250). Do not even think about it if you are into sports and high speed action (get the D300). And do not get me started if you are one of those 'experts' who needs a 'noise free' shot at ISO 3000-25000 (who needs that, really!)
