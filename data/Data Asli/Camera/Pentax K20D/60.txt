Wish I actually knew how great MY camera was, but someone made a mistake the day I ordered my K20D and put a price of something like $250.00 on it, which many people leaped on and lost out, when they cancelled the orders later that morning and put the K20 back up to the rather more 'normal' prices in the high $600s or low $700s, can not remember which.  So I cannot comment on how wonderful MY K20D is, but I have borrowed my father's, and it is a great camera--wonderful low light autofocusing compared to the K10D, excellent images, resolution, saturation etc, even at fairly high ISOs like 800.  I have taken pictures at ISO 1600 with it as well, and although they were significantly noisy, it was fairly easily de-noised using a plug-in noiseware reduction for Photoshop.  All in all, I cannot wait to get my own K20D--hopefully that will be any day!
