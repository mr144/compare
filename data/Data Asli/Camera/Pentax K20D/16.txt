This is a really solid camera. It feels solid yet comfortable in my hands--I do have fairly large hands so take that into account.I love the fact you can access all the main functions with external buttons and dials without having to go into a software menu.I am not going to go into all the details because there are so many but count on reading the manual several times, because even though the main buttons and dials can access the main functions, you will not know how without the manual. For example, after owing the camera for a couple of months I just learned the other day how to change iso without using the Fn button.I was debating getting the K-7 but I decided to save the money and get some quality glass instead. Most people are going to go through several bodies (at least) in their life but a great piece of glass will last you forever.Of course, I will not lie, the 14.6mp does not hurt;)
