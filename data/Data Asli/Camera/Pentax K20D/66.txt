I can not believe the quality of the K20D, especially for under $1000.  Weather sealing, excellent image quality up to ISO 1600 and usable at 3200, quick and easy menu system, wonderful viewfinder, image stability for any lens you put on it, the list goes on and on.  There are plenty of more detailed reviews, but to sum them up, this is a steal.
