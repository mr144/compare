Finally Pentax got it right.  Not only does it have shake reduction built into the body, a great sensor, but it also has native DNG Raw format, a Sync port every other Pentax camera has been missing, 100 ISO, great colors, compatible with the BG2 grip, added Dynamic Range in the ISO200 and up, and great battery life.  Oh, and it is a 14+ megapixel camera, which is what a lot will be looking at, but that was just a bonus for me.
