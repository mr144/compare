Not sure what to say--picked this up expecting it to take solid photos (at least better than an entry-level digital camera at half the price) and almost all interior shots are somewhat blurry no matter what the camera mode. The different features are appreciated, but when the camera takes lousy pictures they do not do much to salvage this purchase...
