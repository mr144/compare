The camera arrived quickly but I was disconcerted that the proprietary USB cable Fuji Film uses was absent. I called the company and they quickly responded by crediting my account the cost of a new cable. Great customer service that fixed my problem to the best of their ability since the cable is not sold separately by them. I would definitely recommend this company not only for their low prices, but the quality of their customer service.
