This camera does all it claims to do, it takes  great pics just be sure to learn  navigating the menu, it has a lot features and you do not want to miss any of them. My only complaint is that like any non SLR they fail miserably in the action shot area, if the subject is moving it is only going to be a clear shot about half the time.  Very nice still shots though.
