This camera is exactly what I wanted. Still have tons to learn on 'how to use' properly.The zoom is amazing...captures my birds easily.Have taken pix thru storm door, and they were as clear as if outside!Friends helped me choose this camera...they were  didead on' for what I needed.Looking fwd to years of fun w/this camera.
