I am a complete newbie to digital cameras other than BASIC point and shoot Kodak Easy Share I had about 6 years ago.  This camera is great for a beginner like me.  I shot some nice close ups of flowers outdoors in the macro setting and in auto setting just using the zoom feature, and am happy with both ways.  I did take multiple shots to get great ones, but that is probably typical. So far I have only used the auto setting, and the Scene recognition setting and am happy so far, looking forward to playing with manual settings soon.The camera is comfortable to hold and shoot both one and two handed.  Feels like a good solid camera.  The lens cap is basically useless and falls off if you look at it wrong, but no biggie.  I would recommend this to someone looking to get into photography and also for the weekend shot taker.Not sure about battery life as I have only had it for 3 days, but I have taken a few hundred shots so far and still going strong.  The Viewfinder is also great in the bright sunlight when the LCD does not show up as well, and all the info displayed on the LCD is also displayed in the viewfinder.If you are considering this camera, just go for it, you will like it.  I wavered for almost a month and wish I had just ordered it back then.  The price on Amazon is at least $20 cheaper than anywhere I have seen it in stores here in Michigan.
