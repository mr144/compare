Tried video and pics at the grapevine mall's aquarium.  Lousy! ...My friend's cell phone camera took better shots! And better video too...I got lots of grainy videos and pics. The camera could not stay in focus no mater what I did! We have two of these type of camera and both mine and my s.o. camera had the same issues! Grainy out of focus shots and our cell phone cameras were way better!.. I know cameras and believe me this thing is garbage. I will be getting rid of ours ASAP!  low light? Forget it. This camera is not for anyone who is serious about qaulity video or stills. And quite frankly I think its closer to a 'toy aisle ' camera than the real thing. This camera is a 'sunny day -good exposure' kind of camera and is worthless for documenting experiences where low light conditions are prevalent.  I suppose this camera would be good for people who want to take an hour to set up the shot. But random photos and conditions outside of ideal lighting,movement and weather do not work well for this piece of crap....It is the 1980s huyundai of digital cameras
