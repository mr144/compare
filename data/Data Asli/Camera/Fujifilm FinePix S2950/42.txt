This is a very good camera. the pics are sharp and clear and has very good manual settings, if you are going to use video, the audio isnt that good, but i use the video for skate videos on youtube and its pretty good, if you want some examples just check our channel and every video clip without fish eye is the fuji film, just look up kook-eye skateboarding on youtube our channel is kook eye and i think you will like the performance
