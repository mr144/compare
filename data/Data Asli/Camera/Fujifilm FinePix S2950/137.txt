The camera is awesome... had the early model 10mp.  This also was a great camera but got stolen.  The outdoor pictures are great.  However the indoor pictures need more work. Still working on how to perfect them.  But for the price and what you get... you can not beat it.  I would buy another Fuji and I have already recommended it to a fried who also purchased it.
