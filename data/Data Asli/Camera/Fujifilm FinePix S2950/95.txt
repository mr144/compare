I read the reviews so much.. i figured i wanted a really good camera to start taking photo's of my family. however this does a good job, BUT its not any better than my other point and shoot!  i have yet to learn everything. i have only had this camera for 24 hrs now. It does the job.. i do not like the fact the flash is not right there when i need it..i have to push a button and pop it out! the battery directions are honestly complicated.. who new putting batteries in your camera was complicated!hmmm anyways, i guess over all this will be ok, just not what i expected for getting such a high star rateing! THE CAMERA IS LIGHT, you need just the right light settings for your picture to turn out correct. most of the pictures i have taken are a little fuzzy as well.  good luck
