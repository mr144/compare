I purchased this for my daughter, who is taking photography in high school.  As soon as she opened it, she creamed, Camera 4!  This is one of the cameras they use in class, and apparently this is the class favorite.  They rush to class to get this one.  So enough said, I am her hero for getting this camera.  She has been using it constantly every since.
