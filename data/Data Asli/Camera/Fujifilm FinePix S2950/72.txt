I have to say this. Too many people turn this camera down because it does not do well in the auto shooting format. Well I am here to say something. I did not purchase this to shoot genetic automatic Shots. I bought it for the powerful lens, but mostly the fact it has nearly full manual controls. If you want a standard point and shoot, look elsewhere. to sell this at this price point and afford to put these manual controls, they had to sacrifice somewhere. Buy a point and shoot at this price point with no manual controls you'll be happier if you do not want manual control.Now that that is over with, I'll tell you what's great. Zoom is great especially macro. Having the evf is great for stable shots. photos are crisp, well colored and very detailed. ISO200/400 is great for everyday use. All of this paragraph is referring to full manual mode shooting. Aperture and shutter priority is great as well.Only flaws? Video optical zoom is noisy, and photo ISO noise is rough advice 800.This camera it is not a point and shoot. For the price the manual controls are amazing. Panoramic shots are awesome with the right scene. If you want more power than just a point and shoot, get this camera.This camera deserves more respect, do not knock it for something it want intended for.
