I bought this camera after my other digital camera was stolen.  its an upgrade from my other one so it took me a little while to figure out all the different functions.  I love this camera it takes great pictures!  i wanted something profesional but not too extreme i am a beginner and wanted something easy.  this is the camera!  i think its great for beginers as well as someone that knows what they are doing!  Highly Recommended!!
