I specifically bought this camera because it was big and had the view finder. When I bought it from best buy the pics i took were ok. When i tried to record video there is this annoying white noise. I contacted fujifilm & they thought it was the zooming in & out issue. I told them NO and sent them a 30second video clip. They came back saying we tested are cameras too and the white noise sound you hear on video mode seems to be a characteristic of the camera. I thought fujifilm was the top of the line but if they are putting out crap like this it a  no brainer why it was on sale.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!Severely disappointed!!!
