Beautiful Camera - Just the right weight - not too light and not too heavy.  The LCD screen is large enough to be able to view your photos.  The only problem is - Watch out for the battery door.  It is so flimsy that it seems to be hanging on a thread.  Whoever invented this was not too clever.  A better system would have been like the old Fuji cameras where the XD or SD card was in a separate chamber.  This is why I did not rate the camera five stars.  Otherwise. for this inexpensive price you got yourself a great deal.
