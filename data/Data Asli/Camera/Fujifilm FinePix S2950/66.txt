I AM VERY, VERY PLEASED WITH MY NEW FINEPIX S2950 IT TAKES GREAT PICS. AND VERY SIMPLE TO USE. I HAD NO PROBLEM WITH IT RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, YES TO REALLY KNOW ALL THE THINGS IT CAN DO TAKE TIME TO READ THE BOOK VERY HELPFULL. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA HIGHLY VERY GOOD SARTER AND FOR GREAT MOVIES. I HAVE MANY GRANDCHILDREN AND IT REALLY WORKS GREAT FOR PICS OF THEM.... OVER ALL GREAT CAMERA...
