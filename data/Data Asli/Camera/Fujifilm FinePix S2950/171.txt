Have had this for a couple months, now. Cool little camera! If you are not into spending $500+ for a DSLR, this is probably the next best thing. Many functions of a DSLR, but no ability to change lenses. A little slow between photos, but acceptable for the amateur. Quality of photos very good thanks to 14 megapixels. I was surprised at the zoom - 18x, but I guess I did not realize the power of 18! I did use the word 'awesome', but... One of my must-have features was a viewfinder, which is hard to find on point_and_shoot cameras. I find it easier to use, bracing it against your face gives you a steadier hand, and it gives you a more precise view than the screen. The size is perfect - lightweight and easy to carry around. Feels good in hands. Grip allows one-handed shooting if necessary. Videos are clear. Sound could be better, but, hey, the camera is less than $200! A snap to transfer photos/videos to your pc, Facebook, etc. All-in-all, an excellent value. Took this thing to Yosemite twice and got some brilliant photos and videos.  Pleased as puch, I am.
