Great for taking pictures (But I prefer all of my pictures be taken in flash with this one)Really exceptional with the HD videos, I am always recording rehearsals and concept choreography projects as a dancer so this bad boy comes in EXTRA handy. Not so big and bulky, great for a startup camera. Ca not be used with any double A batteries, must be heavy duty double A or it will die in a matter of 5 minutes of use. (I have experienced it and I hate it) Definitely recommend rechargeable batteries. I need to invest in some myself!
