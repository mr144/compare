first off I would have given this a 5 star except the lens cap is not secure.  When out traveling or with the kids I toss the camera in the bag and off we go. I have not hunted down a possible solution for this annoying happening. I know some of the other reviews complained about this too. they were correct.  Otherwise as a family camera, it is great.  videos and picture quality are great for everyday use.  the camera is slight bulkier then the other slim point and shoots but the quality is worth it.  I cannot afford an SLR and wanted something better then a pocket size camera.  This is wonderful middle ground for a novice photographer.  the manual options are more then I will ever use and the auto setting are right on.
