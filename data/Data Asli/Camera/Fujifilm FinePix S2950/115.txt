I bought the Fugiflim S2950 And so far seems to be a great camera for the price,and takes great pictures ,fits nice to the hand. And a big thing for me is the electronic view finder.I have had cameras with out it and it is real hard to take pitchers on a black screen on a sunny day.I will not buy them again. Thank you.  R.M.
