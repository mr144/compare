I upgraded to this from a little kodak point and shoot digital camera.  I wanted to step into the world of digital SLR's, but I did not have the funding for that yet.  So, I looked into one of these.  It's everything I was looking for, at a better than expected price.  It takes some really nice shots, especially if you get to learn the settings a bit.  I have not discovered any downsides to this camera yet.  I can not wait to take this on one of my hikes!
