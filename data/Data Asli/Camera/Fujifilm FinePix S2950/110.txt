Camera came on time in perfect condition. It was a Christmas gift for my wife but I gave it to her early so she could use it during the holidays. She went crazy with it! We live on a tropical island so she was always going to the beach and the rain forest to take photos. The quality of the photos and the zoom were amazing. Great features especially for the price. Would think cause it uses 4 batteries it would wste alot of power but it does not! I bought some Walgreens Alkaline Batteries that were on sale and I used those babies for almost a week of non-stop photo sessions. No cons yet. It's a great buy.
