I have yet to put my new S2950 to the test by actually using it in real field conditions, so perhaps I am way premature in commenting; however, there are a couple of things that, had I been aware of them before the purchase, would have been deal breakers for me.The aperature ranges that I have seen published for the S2950 are F3.1-F6.4 (wide) and F5.6-F11 (tele).  What I have not seen mentioned is that the extremes are the only settings one can choose on both Aperature Priority or Full Manual.  In other words, at any focal length, there are only two aperature settings that can be chosen--in the case of the shortest focal length, one is able to choose only F3.1 or F6.4, nothing between.  The other thing of which I was unaware is that, while a specific ISO can be set on Aperature and Full Manual, on Shutter Priority, ISO can be set only on Auto, with a ceiling of either ISO 400 or ISO 800.  I guess this makes sense; since the lens has only two aperature settings, the ISO has to slide to accomodate the partial stop differentials at which the shutter can be set, but that does not mean I have to like it.Before I close, I probably should mention that I am a D-SLR user, used to complete control, who purchased this camera as a convenient option to allow me to take photos without five pounds of camera hanging from my neck.  As such, I might be looking for more than would the average bridge camera purchaser.  On the other hand, my old Kodak 610, which I foolishly gave away, allowed me the ability to set the aperature to any opening across its entire (wider)range, and to set a specific ISO in any photo mode.
