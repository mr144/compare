I got this camera for school at the beginning of June for my photography class. I am not going to mumble on about the specs of this thing but how well it does its job. (we all know we use automatic mode half the time and it takes good pics in auto mode.) This camera is very good and takes astounding photos but, when the battery gets low the pictures suffer a lot. This one mode called panorama is amazing, it matches up, up to 3 pictures to create a long scene which is amazing! My 1 and only gripe is that the zoom will not work sometimes, usually a matter of turning off and on but still, annoying!
