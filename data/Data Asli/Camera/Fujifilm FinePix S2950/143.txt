Purchased this camera to hold us over until we bought a DSLR.  Basically this camera is perfect for our needs.  It takes great pictures right out of the box, everything works very well, very intuitive.  We even dropped it on ceramic tile and it did not even scratch it (lucky).  I am recommending it to all my friends.
