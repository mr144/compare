I have been looking for a decent camera that will not break my bank account and this seems to be the one.  I have taken pictures as soon as the camera arrived and it works great.  Thanks to everyone who reviewed the camera as the majority were quite accurate.  The camera is easy to handle and comes with four AA batteries.  I bought a 32GB memory card the same time I bought the camera so that both arrived together.  Everything came together within a couple of days (memory card, camera case, and camera).  The pictures I have taken looks great, and I especially like the panorama feature.  If you want to record a video, a 32GB memory card will only record for 10 minutes before you run out of memory.  As to the durability and life of the camera, obviously I do not know since I only received the camera today.  But I must say, I recommend this camera as I am confident it will last a long time.
