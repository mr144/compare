Serious camera for the price, more features than just a point and shoot.  If you are just capturing the moment, use your cell phone camera.  This is for taking quality pics.  Out of the box use is simple enough on Auto, but you will need to read the instruction book to get the most out of its many features.  Only down side is that the auto focus illuminator (used in low light settings) is very bright, almost laser like and can be distracting to the subject.  This can be turned off in the settings, but where it is placed, it is easier to just slide a finger in front of it lol!!Overall fit and finish is great, feel is solid, would recommend
