I have not owned the camera very long, so can not give a solid review of its performance, but I do have a warning for possible buyers. I have a tripod (a cheap one) that has fit 4 other cameras, but for some reason does not work with this one. If you are planning to use it on a tripod, I would bring your tripod with you to the store and make sure it fits. Not looking forward to having to shell out more money for a new tripod, but can not use this camera as planned until I do!
