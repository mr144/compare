This is my first SLR Camera so even though I have had it for about 2 months now I am still learning new things about it every time I take it out.  It's very easy to figure out, thankfully since the index that comes with it has minimal information in it.  I have used it in nature shots, family get together, animals, and water shots.  All have turned out spectacular!  I would recommend this for an easy to use novice SLR camera user, and I am sure it works just as well for a mature photographer as well.
