Excellent camera, my second Fujifilm camera, the first being the S6000. Trouble with the S2950 is that it is probably just a matter of time before the battery door breaks off (very cheaply made). The lens cap falls off easily (not a big deal), but  the worst thing is that the owner's manual is a pdf file. I always like having a manual in my camera bag in case I need to find something quick while away from the computer. The pdf file is 141 pages, too large to print and keep in the bag. Fujifilm could have spent a couple of dollars more on the battery door, the lens cap, and a usable manual and they could raise the price of the camera a couple of dollars to cover it all and then it would be a perfect package.
