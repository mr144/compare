This camera takes beautiful pictures, and the pop-up flash works fantastic even in total darkness.  Pictures are crisp and clear, and the manual settings are great for advanced photographers.  The editing software in the camera is helpful too so you can crop, rotate or resize your photos before uploading them, as well as saving them to their own albums for later.  I would very highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants to take thousands of casual everyday pictures, or step it up a notch and take professional grade photos.
