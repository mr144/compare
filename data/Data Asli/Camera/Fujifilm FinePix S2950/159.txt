I bought this camera a week ago from Best Buy when it was on sale.  I am going on a trip to China and was thinking that I would kick myself if I did not invest in a new Camera.  The s2950 seemed like the most bang for your buck.  It is.  I have always been a fan of Fuji after previously owning there Finepix F20.  I did a side by side comparison of the photos took by each and there is hands-down no question proof that the S2950 takes much much better shots and is a vast improvement over my antiquated F20. I mean I could visually see how awesome the S2950 is.  Lots of features, half of which I will not use.  The 18x zoom is incredible.  The panorama as others have said is very awesome and very easy to use.  The pictures themselves are very crisp and clear.  The people saying it only takes ok pictures obviously are not using the correct settings for their situation.  I also like the shutter select option as I plan on taking some artsy waterfall pictures while I am there.  The pop-up flash is powerful.  This is the first camera I have owned with a pop-up so I have caught myself acouple times forgetting to pop it up. The lens cap as others have said is flimsy. It has yet to fall off but once I put it in a bag I imagine it will.  The battery and SDHC compartment door also seems flimsy, going to have to be careful as you should be any way. All in all I am extremely happy with my investment and have not second guessed it since I took the first picture. 5/5.
