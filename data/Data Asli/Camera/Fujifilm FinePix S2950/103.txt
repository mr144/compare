Excellent step from point and click to DSLR.  I have been having fun with it on vacations and at family functions over the last few months.For those who say the camera does not take good pictures inside, they are probably using the incorrect settings.  I have had no problems thus far.  Just play with it until you have got a good feel for what works.
