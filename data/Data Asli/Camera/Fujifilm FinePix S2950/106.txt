I probably had the defective camera. I had it on auto mode. The images were cloudy/smudgy indoors even with flash. I did not bother to try the rest of the settings. I returned it and bought a different camera. For example, I took photos of flowers in a vase. The flowers were not defined and looked like the colors were scattering (like a smudge).
