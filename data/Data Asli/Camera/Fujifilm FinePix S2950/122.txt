In the few months that I have owned the Fuji Finepix, I have taken well over 1,000 shots. So far, it is done a decent job. In my personal experience, I have been impressed with its performance outdoors and indoors with flash or in well-lit areas. It has not performed particularly well indoors without a flash when the lighting is low.Pros:-Excellent 18x zoom with wide angle lens.-Stunning outdoor photography in daylight.-Solid indoor photography with flash, or in well-lit rooms.-A strong flash. Can light up a large, pitch black Cathedral-style church.-Very good picture quality in video mode; 720p.-Panorama mode.-Optional pop-up flash. Not having to go through the menu every time to turn off the flash like I am forced to do with my Canon is a plus.-Good grip to the camera. It feels comfortable in your hands.-Uses 4 AA batteries (highly recommend rechargeable).-Nice battery discharge feature.-Viewfinder.-Large LCD screen.-Quick start up time. Fairly quick shot to shot time, save when using flash.-High ISO available.-Continuous shooting available.Cons:-Poor indoor low-light photographs.-Camera zooming and autofocusing are LOUD in video mode.-Panoramic shots often do not stitch well.-No manual focus.-The auto white balancing leaves a lot to be desired.It's certainly not a professional camera or a perfect one, but it is a very good camera that most would find appealing. Very easy to use, and takes solid pictures except in low light. Looks spiffy too!
