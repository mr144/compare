I bought this camera in an 'emergency' in Kathmandu when my other camera failed the day before I was due to leave on a one month trek in the mountains. I did not have a lot of time to compare cameras or read any reviews. The reason I wanted this one specifically is because it has a manual viewfinder (not just an LCD screen) which is hard to find in budget cameras these days! I hate the cameras that only have the LCD screen, because it is so hard to see what you are shooting in bright sunlight. I also wanted a camera that took normal batteries, rather than a special battery that had to be recharged. In the mountains there was not always electricity, so I would not be able to rely on being able to recharge my battery. I am so impressed with this camera, for the price I paid (which was more than what it is listed here!). I ended up taking some really amazing shots. It is funny too, because many people who do not know a lot about cameras see me with this one and think that it is a fancy, professional camera, haha, I guess because it is chunkier than the average budget point and shoot. Unlike most of the other little point and shoots these days that may only have 5x zoom, it has 18x optical zoom. You can not go wrong with the camera for the price you are paying, just buy it
