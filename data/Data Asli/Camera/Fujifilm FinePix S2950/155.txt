Camera only takes good photos outside in good ambient lighting. Inside photos, no matter what setting or configuration, are horrible. My old Sony 5MP take WAY better photos indoors than this one. This camera is obviously meant strictly for outdoor usage and even then, it is not fantastic, just good. But what more can you ask, you really get what you pay for.
