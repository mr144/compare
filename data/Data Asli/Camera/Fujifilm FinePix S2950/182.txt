I have to say I am a fan of Fuji, and this camera is no exception. I wanted to upgrade to a higher megapixel camera and this seemed the right fit for me. The cosmetic changes Fuji made compared to my old camera are minor.(I am glad they did not change the body style)It's still light enough so that it does not feel bulky but sturdy enough that it 'feels' like a camera. They moved the media card slot inside with the batteries (I prefer them separate) but it is better than the media card slot on the older version of this camera which tended to pop open unknowingly. You do have to be aware of how you are holding the camera so you do not lose the batteries. I also liked the versatility of being able to use more than one type of media card (they removed that feature on this camera). They added the panoramic feature which is cool and the shutter speed is faster so that makes the continuous mode a lot more fun to use! The auto flash feature you have to engage ( it was automatic on the older version) Overall, still a great buy.
