if you have a faulty Camera then send it back but if not, learn it before you comment about it! .. I do not understand all the negative feedback.. I almost did not purchase one because of it! .. I am glad I decided to do some research and make up my own mind.. do a search at YouTube and look for the fujiguys channel.. they have videos to get you familiar with it and the features PLUS they answer any questions you may have! .. and if you want to see some actual photos taken with the Camera, do a search at Flickr! .. I ordered this Camera and got it a day and a half later which was awesome! .. I already knew some things about it because I done some research.. after playing with it for awhile, it was very easy for me to work it and I am use to Kodak Cameras.. you have got to see the photos taken with this Camera!.. do not expect great results without knowing what you are doing though! .. the only bad thing about the Camera is the software that comes with it.. I got errors and removed it and found out others have had problems as well.. you can still transfer the photos without the software .... my favorite things about the Camera are the super macro and the Panorama.. the Panorama is so easy, it is almost funny! .. you snap the first photo, line the onscreen plus sign up and the Camera takes another for you, then do it again.. it is VERY simple!!.. do not take my word for it or others for that matter.. do your own research and make up your own mind.. it is more than I expected and I love it!..
