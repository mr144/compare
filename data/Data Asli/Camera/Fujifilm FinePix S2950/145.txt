This is a truly great camera. The battery compartment is extremely easy to operate, unlike the previous canon I owned. The pictures that you can take with this camera are of insanely good quality - the video is also pretty good. The macro mode is a feature I use a lot for close-ups of plants. The panorama capability is a nice little gadget, but i do not think i'll ever really use it. Also, the menus are very easy to navigate. There are a ton of features I did not mention, as i am still trying to master the manual mode. Overall, this is an amazing product that i would surely buy again. Just make sure to bet a warranty, just in case.
