I love this camera. I bought it because it has an old school view finder and the display.  Most of the cameras I have looked at have gone away from having a view finder.  I have used many different cameras and on bright day it is very hard to see the display and line up a shot without a view finder. It is very easy to switch between the view finder and the display.It takes fantastic pictures and you can use rechargeable batteries if you want.  Another thing that is great about this camera is the response time between pictures.  My old camera took 10 seconds before I could snap another shot.  This camera is almost instantaneous.
