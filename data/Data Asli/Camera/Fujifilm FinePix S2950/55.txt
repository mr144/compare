I really loved this camera. The 18x zoom worked great, although at first I was not fond of the quality, but once I messed with it for a while, I figured out how to make it better quality even after I had zoomed in all the way. It's light, but not so light that it feels cheap. I am not at all regretting my decision in purchasing this item. It uses 4 AA+ batteries, which is good, because if rechargeable batteries die quickly, and you can not go to the store and buy new ones in case it gets lost or you can not charge it at the time. It's very easy to use, and not very expensive at all. I saw a slightly better camera (the only difference was that it had 20x zoom and 16 MP) by Nikon for twice the price. Over all, it was pretty stinkin' amazing.
