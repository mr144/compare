After my digital camera broke I wanted something that I knew would last, but Im not into photography, I just like taking nice pictures, I did not want to break the bank. So I went to target and saw this, they wanted $250 for it. I come on here and see it and with the price I had to get it. I played with it and got familiar with the settings, and for me I think it takes good pictures indoors and out. I was not expecting a top notch camera with a bunch of different settings. But for this price, and its quality, I think its a great buy. I take good care of it, I really do not see me buying a new camera anytime soon.
