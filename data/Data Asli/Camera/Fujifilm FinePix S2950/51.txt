We have had this camera for 3 months now and it is not as good at really impressive pictures as my old Olympus 10x optical.  I tried to take a pic of a brown recluse spider, just to compare, and could not get the macro to work.  A few days back, i tried to zoom in on some boats in the distance.  Beyond recognizing them as houseboats, not much good. I took some better shots with my droid phone and could blow them up, then crop the excess, including the close up of the spider.I have had a fair number of cameras that exceeded my abilities.  This one is not as smart as it should have been to make up for my skills.  My Canon slr and the Olympus i think were better at taking good pics without having to manually adjust.The panorama feature is nice, and it does take good, long movies (for a camera).  And it takes good pics if you have a no brainer shot at up to 30 ft and good light, or within flash distance.My recommendation is to go somewhere you can test the features better than i did.I would send this back if i could and look for another.  Does not work as well as i expected for the money.
