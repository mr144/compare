This camera is actually pretty neat. It takes some very nice pictures, and i think that the Micro focusing is very nice. Those particular pictures are nice and crisp. Definitely good for an amateur who is just looking to take some decent-quality photos. Only thing I would have to complain about is the fact that the software that comes with it (and also available online) is highly outdated for the Mac OSX. If you are running Lion, you will not be able to use the software, because it is PowerPC based, and includes a version of quicktime written for Panther (which is almost ten years out-dated)! Luckily, the camera hooks up into iPhoto just fine, so there is no problem there. I have not tried it with ImageCapture, but I do not see why there would be an issue. Anyway, its a great camera. Really glad I bought it :)
