This camera is the perfect choice for starters who want to gradually increase their photograph skills.It is very easy to use and the basic functions are really intuitive, so you do not need to read the manual to start shooting.Yo have very high picture quality and a 'point and shoot' mode that allows you to get great pictures every time.With low light conditions you can also get very good results, but you need to combine the flash and scene selection to achieve them.If you want to have more control (and know what you are doing) you could use the manual adjustments just like a professional camera.If this camera had interchangeable lenses, it would be a professional camera.
