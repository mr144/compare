We bought this camera because we wanted one to take higher quality photos and videos.  The pictures we have taken have been good.  But the video is REALLY BAD.We used this camera to film my granddaughters' dance recital.  The videos are worthless.  I thought that maybe we did not have the settings right.  But my son, who is a professional photographer and videographer, saw nothing wrong with the settings.  I suppose we will use this camera for stills only.  Another thing (my fault) is the fact that the camera uses 4 AA batteries, which last about one day.  We have another Finepix camera which has a charging base, and I assumed this one would have one, too.  Again, this was my fault. We would never have purchased this camera had we known the video would be so poor.
