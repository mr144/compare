I am a professional photographer, and have many camera's, including $3,000 ones. But it is not practical to lug them around with me every where I go, not to allow the little ones to play with, so I bought this one. It's small, light weight and has some of the manual settings I love to adjust on my D-SLRs. Unfortunately, there are only 2 F-stop options, and most of the other manual settings are limited. This camera is perfect for kids, or for people who usually use automatic settings and want something nicer than the pocket sized ones wal mart sells, or like in my case, one that's less of a loss if you accidentally drop it in the water taking beach shots of the kids. It's a great value for the money, but you have a need for total control of all your manual setting, this might not be for you.
