I purchased this camera because it had a viewfinder.  That was a great feature to have since I was going to travel down the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River.  Unfortunately I had not used the camera enough before the trip to realize on the Automatic settings it was not possible to reduce the ISO setting below 800.  On Manual settings either the shutter speed would not adjust reasonably thus getting blurred pics or the ISO would stay at 800 even though I tried to change it both on Auto and on regular setting. Therefore I have many picture of the Canyon that are washed out without the true color.  I am going to see if there is a way to return the camera for possible exchange or repair.
