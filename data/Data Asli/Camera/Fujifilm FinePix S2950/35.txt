I ordered this camera so when I go the the girls next Cheerleading competition, I would have my video in HD  (I currently have an 8 year old Kodak that takes gorgeous photos and videos, but is not HD).I bought brand new high quality batteries and put them in. I tested the photos first. First I tried Normal on the Auto setting.  Then I tested the Panoramic setting, followed by the video in HD. The macro is fantastic - Took pictures from about a foot away to see the quality of the macro setting.  They looks slightly grainy to me so I put the SDHD card in my laptop to check it out.  Although the photo did come out non-blurry, it was very grainy.I checked the panoramic photo.  The stitching was really good, however, was again grainy.I then checked the video. Ei Yi Yi -- If I wanted to take a video of the oceanside or a waterfall, it would be great.  The background sound is horrible - like rushing water.  When using the telephoto to pull objects closer, it has a distinctive 'click click click' noise.The camera is being returned tomorrow... end of story.
