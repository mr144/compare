I bought this as a replacement for my old fujifilm s3200 which has lasted me 7 years.  It had been dropped down stair and scratched up and works great to this day.  I wanted a better camera with good video features.  This one seemed good on paper.  It worked okay for about a month but I noticed purple lines in almost all of my videos.  Then the on/off switch started giving me problems.  Sometimes it works sometimes it does not.  Sometimes it slides, sometimes it clicks.  It is constantly faulty now and I can turn my camera on and it will turn off immediately because the switch is not working.  I contacted Fujifilm about it and they told me to ship the camera at my expense to them and they would determine if it is under warranty!  I just bought it a month ago!  I am seriously disappointed in Fujifilm.  I wish I could return it to amazon but it is just past my 1 month return date.  I really want a different camera and this will be the last fujifilm I buy.
