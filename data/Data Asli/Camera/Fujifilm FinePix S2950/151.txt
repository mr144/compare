i have been doing photography for more years than i want to admit.  my first digital was a fuji and i loved it.  this camera has very poor quality focus, even with a still shot.  it is manual and automatic settings are poor at best.  i tried for days and gave up, sending it back.  i ended up with a sony which is gold.  i can not give it any rating, it is that bad but amazon requires a star.  do not be fooled, this review gives it a ZIP.
