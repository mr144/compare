Got it for my wife who knows nothing about digital cameras. In no time at all she was taking beautiful pictures. Good combination of auto click features and manual over-rides for artistic work. Old-fashioned view-finder as well as screen is a really aid when shooting outdoors in bright light that can may screen viewing difficult. Nice that it runs on common AA batteries available everywhere.As some other reviewers have noted, the lens cap pops off too easily and the door for the batteries is flimsy, so I recommend that anyone who buys this camera buy a cheap case for it so you do not risk losing those important covers.Also, note, this camera does not come with a memory card. So if you plan to surprise someone with a gift, as I did, you better take the camera out of the box, go spend a few bucks on a memory card, and put it in. Fortunately, I had done exactly that, so my wife was able to open it on Christmas Day and start using it immediately.It's not professional quality DSLR, but it is also no where near the cost of a DSLR. For 'bridge camera' between the click and the DSLR it is very good and I highly recommend it.
