I bought this camera (Fujifilm Finepix S2950) because I had a daughter - and I have always loved photography but could not afford a $600-$1200 camera. I thought 14 megapixel and 18x wide angle lens, I should be pretty happy with it.I could not be happier - except now the camera is a little older - and the pictures are blurry/fuzzy more often then not. I bought the extended warranty - and I am going to send it back, to get a replacement. I Love this camera - it takes AMAZING outdoor shots. Better then anything a regular little handheld digital camera or cell phone could take! I would be cautious when using the flash. It worked GREAT when I first bought the camera - and then it kinda just started going downhill. As for the picture resolution and how the pictures turn out - I love it when its working correctly. Another downfall, is it takes 4 batteries (AA) instead of 2 - so, rechargeable batteries are a must. I have 8, I use 4 and I charge 4 at all times. If you use your camera more then casually, I would suggest maybe an extra (3rd) set (one for charge, one for use, and one for backup). Other then the batteries, and the downhill flash, I would still recommend this camera to family/friends, because it does take WONDERFUL outdoor shots!If buying this camera, which in my opinion would be good for starting out photographers, or people who want that professional looking shot without the professional price! I would suggest getting an extended warranty, maybe 3 or 5 years. It's a little pricey - but worth it!
