This is an SLR Style digital camera meaning that while offering a lot of the same features as an Digital SLR it does not offer the ability to switch lenses and certain other higher end features.  However, If you are not a pro photographer and have no aspirations to be one or are on a budget and just starting this is a high qualty 14 mp Camera with just about every feature of the DSLRs and an amazing lens range and image quality at a tenth of the price! It is also light enough to handle with one hand.The box comes with batteries, a nice strap, a lens cover, a quick start paper manual, a splitter cable that will allow the camera to communicate directly with your tv video/audio in ports or via usb to your Win 7 PC, and a cd with a full owner's manual and a crapy photo software I do not recomend installing. The box does not come with storage card and the camera does not have internal memory, which for me was no draw back since as a computer geek I had a handful of sd cards and adapter for micro and mini sd memory cards laying around the desktop and just dropped in a 16 gb card and it was recognized and I was able to start shooting right away.  I think the sd mem card was a kingston brand micro card in an sd adapter.  I am pretty sure anything recognized by Windows will be recognized by the camera so if you have one laying around you do not have to get another right away.This is a great value without compromising quality and functionality and I recomend it Highly.
