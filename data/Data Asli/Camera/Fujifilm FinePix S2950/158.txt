Decided to get this camera and experiment before i make the jump to an SLR andi am glad i did. This camera has fantastic features for the price. Picture quality is on par with what i expected and this is just using th Automatic settings. Ca not wait to drill down and use manual settings. Body may be a bit small for those with large hands, but i ai not complaining. This was/is a good buy.
