This is a fantastic camera! It takes really great, sharp photos and has lot of features. The menu and options are easy to use, and so far, the battery life with regular AA batteries is outstanding. I have been using the camera for several weeks with the same set of batteries.I have been shopping for a new camera for over a year, but just could not stand the $500 or more price tag on other cameras with similar features. This is a great buy for under $200.
