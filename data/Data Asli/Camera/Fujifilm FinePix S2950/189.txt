I really like this camera which was a part of a graduation gift by my friends. For me it serves the purpose of mini slr camera and I love the way pictures come out. They are very crisp and clear. Also, with the non shakiness the blurriness is reduced. All in all a good purchase for the price.Pros: It's very light weight, less blurry pictures, not to noisy, excellent zoom, too many functionsCons: Works on 4 AA cells and hence is a pain (keep rechargeable batteries along with), bit bulky than normal digi cams
