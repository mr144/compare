I bought this camera because I have been into photography for a while but I can not afford a nice DSLR camera, and this seemed like a nice bridge camera to get.  I WAS VERY WRONG. I did read the reviews before purchasing this, and I almost did not buy it because of the bad reviews, but there were so many good ones I decided to buy it anyway.  I should have listened to the bad reviews. The image quality is HORRIBLE, it is extremely grainy and the colors are extremely off.  The settings are hard to navigate and the camera is not very user friendly. I can not figure out how to change any of my manual settings.  I do NOT reccomend anyone buy this camera unless you want to waste your money.  For those of you who think this camera is great you are clearly very BLIND. I will be returning this camera and saving to buy a nice camera. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!
