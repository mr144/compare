the camera looks very professional, quality materials, making it tough, has a good zoom and many modes and scenes to take photos, but ultimately the quality of the photos is not as good, the photos do not have bright colors, is seen as opaque even have photos of cameras compared to other brands that are less professional and these are more alive and better quality, for the price I think it is okay but not as good as it looks.  thats my oppinion
