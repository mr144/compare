I took this camera to Europe for six weeks and now I am selling it. It's not that I am dissatisfied, it is just that this camera taught me what I truly wanted in a super zoom camera. I discovered that I use a camera like this as a video camera as much as a still camera -- maybe more. As a video camera it only shoots 720px HD, and the zoom (which loses focus while filming) is not useful.As a still camera, it is hard to beat for the money. I especially like the viewfinder: viewfinders are a necessity in bright sunshine. I hardly used the LCD (for shooting) at all.Au revoir, Dear Fuji. You did a great job.
