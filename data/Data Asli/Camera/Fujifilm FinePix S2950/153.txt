I purchased this camera because of the megapix size (14mp) and its compactness. I have a much more complicated Digital SLR, however it is just too bulky to take everywhere. This Fiji is graeat for outings, weekend trips, etc. The electronic viewfinder is great. I do not like the fact that so many of the newer generation digital cameras only have an LCD screen. I am from the old school 35mm photography and I insist on a viewfinder. I have been using 35mm film cameras for over forty years. The 3in LCD screen is quite nice to view your shots. The wide variety of exposure settings is impressive and suits any condition that I encountered thus far. I have had not had the S2950 long enough to express any cons just yet. So far I have been very pleased with the results.
