i like the fuifilm fine pix camera so far.  the pictures are clear and the color good.  i found that sometimes when i am at 16x the camera just does not work or is very fuzzy..  i wish i had known that there was not a booklet with the camera.  the disc is fine but i have no reference when i am not near the computer.
