I have to say this camera does a really great job of taking pictures! I love it! This camera is really great if your wanting to get into photography. I bought this camera 12/26/11 a day before this review at Bestbuy and Was excited to unpackage it and start taking photos. I love the size of this camera and the x18 zoom it has. There are also many other features to play with on this camera. I took this photo of some china berries outside my house: [...]  and the photo quality looks good! Im just amazed with this camera. This camera does not take good quality photos if you do not have enough lighting or natural light. The more light you have the better =)I hope this review helps anyone buy this camera. I highly recommend this!
