This camera is a bargain for the price. It takes great pictures with ease. The number of useful features is way beyond what I expected to get. The controls are logically located and very reachable. One particularly practical feature is that it automatically pushes off the lens cap when you turn it on so no more completely black shots. Do yourself a favor and get one if you are looking for an easy to use high quality camera. I am very satisfied with my choice.Clifford Graham
