I purchased this camera from Fuji and was initially excited about it, but that excitement turned to disappoint after about 15 days when I sent it back to Fuji for a refund.While they market as a DSLR to be truthful my Canon power-shot point and shoot can walk circles around this camera.My biggest problems with this camera are:Picture Quality:While it shoots at 14MP the quality of the picture even on its highest settings is poor at best. The continuous shot mode on 20 shots shoots at only 3MP (My cell phone would shoot better pictures). The pictures are often grainy and the cameras proformance is slow with lag in storing pictures (even with a fast SD card) and there is a lot of delay on the settings buttons. I would push the preview button and it could take several seconds for the menu to come up.Lack of custom settings:The shutter speed only goes as slow as 8', the apature only has 2 adjustment settings, there is no adjustment for ISO, and while it does have a lot of nice features they are often hard to access through various poorly designed menus or complicated button sequences.Battery LifeThe camera used 4 AA batteries and if you are considering purchasing this camera you should definitely buy rechargeable batteries at the same time. This camera will burn through batteries faster than a can of mace at an Occupy Wall Street protest.Cheap feelThe camera has a cheap feel to it, especially so with the battery compartment located on the bottom of the camera that has a tendency to suddenly open or not close all the way.This camera is a good value for someone wanting to take good family pictures but if you know anything about photography this camera will only irritate you beyond belief.
