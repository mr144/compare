Worst camera I have ever had. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this product. Just got it at the end of January, 2012, took it on the trip to Spain with me; ended up taking a lot of pics with it, both day and night, not a single picture or more particularly not a single face on any of those pictures is in focus. Buildings, landscapes are fine but faces are all extremely blurry. I am very disappointed with this product, going to return it hopefully for a full refund.
