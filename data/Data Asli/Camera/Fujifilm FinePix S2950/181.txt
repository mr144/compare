My husband bought this camera for me as an early birthday present. I was using just a standard Nikon digital camera but using this one is like a whole new realm of amazing. I enjoy everything about this camera. I read the manual that came with it and it is fairly simple to use. We live in the desert and you will not find this camera far from me, ever.
