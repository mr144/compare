After reading some of the reviews I hesitated in purchasing this camera. I am so thrilled I did not take them to heart. This camera is better than GE or coolpix.. I love this easy to use yet very professional camera. I Highly recommend this camera. The zoom is just enough for perfect long distance detail. I live on a mountain at 7,000 ft and the pics I have taken are spectacular! Buy this camera , you will not be sorry!
