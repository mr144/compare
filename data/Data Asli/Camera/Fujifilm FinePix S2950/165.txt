I thought my 5 yr. old Fuji Finepix 3800 digital camera was good, but this S2950 is so much better, and cost me about 50% less than the old one. Wide angle lens alone makes a huge difference when shooting cars. This camera also has both a thru the lens and 3 inch LCD view finder. Panorama feature is so easy to use and fun, too!
