I just received this camera as a Christmas gift, I was so excited.  then the flash stopped working.  I contacted fuji via email and they told me to check the mode and batteries...like I had not tried that. Not that they told me which mode to use.  very unhappy and will return it for exchange in hopes that the flash is the only problem...Had to go online for the users manual which was not very helpful.  Wish Fuji would stand behind their product, we'll see I guesswould like to give it a chance, and it was a gift.
