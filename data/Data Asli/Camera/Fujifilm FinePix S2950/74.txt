About two years ago I purchased the fujifilm finepix s1500 with 10 mega pixel and 12x zoom. The camera was great and never had any issues , this year me and my wife took a cruise to Cozumel and Belize. We purchased the fuji s2950 as an upgrade. Most of all the features were the same the difference was the color, everything looked great. I cant really see the difference in the megapixel but the zoom was also a good upgrade. Overall the camera is good, takes good pictures has all the great features needed when taking pictures in nature and out at sea. I gave the rating a 4 because although it takes better pictures not much changed from the models.
