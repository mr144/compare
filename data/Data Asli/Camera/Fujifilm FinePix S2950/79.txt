I do not write reviews often on Amazon, but I felt compelled to write one for this camera. In my opinion there are many misleading reviews for this product. I have been using the camera for a few days without any issues. I actually found the quality of the picture to be quite good, and the shutter time is pretty quick. Sometimes the HD movies have trouble focusing but it did not seem to be a big disruption.Everyone saying that the camera has lousy shutter times in between pictures, probably has a crappy SD card in it. I went from a microSD card in an adapter (class 2 maybe?) to a class 10 SDHC card. BIG difference in shutter time. It would take about a second in between pictures, now its no more than 1/2 second in between. So if your shutter takes a while in between pictures, get a better SD card. Make sure it has a fast write speed (class 6 or above is best). Fujifilm's site recommends class 4 or higher.As for the picture quality being poor, I have tried my camera in all different lighting conditions. In doors during the day with and w/o flash. Outside during the day, and night with flash. Zoomed in and out. Picture quality is not GREAT but its very good. I read the manual and tweaked the settings for the picture quality on the camera which seemed to help. Make sure its set to Image size = L(16:9), and Image quality = F (fine). This should give you the best quality pictures with the camera.Bottom line, no this is not going to be a great camera, but its a very good one for the price range its in. Your average person would like this camera but its not for people big into photography.
