I purchased this camera on sale from a different vender, but was able to use my Amazon Prime account.  First I have to say, I ordered it on a Tuesday, and received it on Wednesday, not the next week, but the very next day.  I did not pay for overnight shipping, so I was all colors of impressed.  The first thing I noticed was the weight.  This camera is heavier than the average point and shoot camera, and larger too.  It will not fit in a pocket.  The packaging was nice, and well thought out. The initial setup was easy, and the camera took great pictures right out of the box.  I set it to the finest, and largest picture setting, to get the best quality possible.  The pictures blew me away.  The flash works very well, and the time from shutter press to acquisition is nice.  There is very little delay.  and when set on continuous photo, there is none what so ever.  The 18x optical zoom is nice.  Having a high optical, low digital zoom is the key to a good photo under zoom situations.  The hand feel of this camera is nice, very much like a 35mm, and the view finder works nicely.  If you wanted to save the batteries, turn off the LCD screen and use the view finder.  Although this is NOT a SLR camera, and the lens is not changeable, this camera is very good for the price.  I am not a professional photographer.  I find  that I have great confidence when shooting photos.  If you are in the market for a camera that can do more than the basic point and shoot, this is a great choice.
