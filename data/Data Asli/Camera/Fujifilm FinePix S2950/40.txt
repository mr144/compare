I am a professional photographer. I purchased this camera for my mother thinking she would enjoy the extra features that it came with. I wish I had known ahead of time that this camera simply does NOT do what it says it does. I give this item two stars for quick shipping and price. When I get my money back I'll let you know.I spent three hours playing with this camera and getting to know its features only to find that it has very limited and pathetic features. The quality of the photos does not go up when altered. Literally, each setting produced the same quality photo; all of them very low. There was so much noise (and remember, I do this for a living with multiple professional DSLRs. I am not just blowing smoke here.) that the photo was impossible to use. It's shutter speed alterations did not correctly change shutter speed (At 125 shutter speed I was getting incredibly dark photos with f/3.6 and a 1600 ISO. Ridiculous.) The lens had severe light aberrations in normal sunlight, and while I am on the topic, the lens zoom did not adhere to the chosen frame setting. (At a selected 16:9, zooming cropped the screen quality. Why in God's name would it do that!?) The manual ability would have been great if it...well it just was not great. 14MP is hardly high quality when it is 14MP of low quality, poorly lit, blurred photos. I am returning this product immediately.At the end of it all I can really only remind you that you are getting what you pay for. Cameras cannot be bought for less than $300 and expected to be up to par with your professional grade DLSRs. My advice, do NOT buy this camera. Look instead to the Canon SX40 HS. It costs over twice as much, but remember, the more you pay the better product you are getting. (Do not quote me on that.)
