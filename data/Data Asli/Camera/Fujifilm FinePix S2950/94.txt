I was so excited to receive this camera so i could use it for shooting at my son's baseball games. It was a little larger than I wanted (it would not fit in your pocket) but small enough to hold comfortably. I did not want a DSLR; I wanted something more for amteurs that could take decent action shots. Unfortunately, the quality of the pictures I took were awful - most still shots were blurry/unclear with 'auto' mode. Also, it was so slow capturing the shots, I could not take a picture of my pet because she would move before the shot was captured. Finally, one of the main reasons I got this camera was for the burst mode for action photos - not only was it extremely slow, the screen was 'black' while it was shooting so you could not even follow the subject. I returned it for a full refund.
