I was gonna give 1 star, but maybe my unit was defective.  The lcd is super grainy.  The audio recording and playback is terribly noisy.  I found a review after I had purchased it that summed it up  as a cheapy point and shoot with a huge lens slapped on it.  I would not recommend this camera to anyone. I am typically skeptical of reviews that mention other products but the Lumix f40 is the bomb. I love it.
