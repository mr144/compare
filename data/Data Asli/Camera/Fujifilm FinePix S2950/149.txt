As soon as I held this camera, I knew something was wrong. I was pleased to find it a bit smaller than the FinePix S5200 I had owned since 2005. But it was lightweight and flimsy: the plastic housing actually seemed to warp slightly under a gentle grip. It felt and looked cheap, right down to the lens cap that did not lock in place.This camera should certainly be an improvement over my older model. It has image stabilization, more megapixels, greater optical zoom, etc. Cameras have come a long way in six years.But it is just inferior. I took several pictures with both, side-by-side, trying both automatic and semi-manual modes. (The S2950 does not offer the manual focus option that the old S5200 offered, so I could not compare that.) In every case, the S2950 took a blurrier, grainier picture.I can not account for its lousiness, but I could return the camera, and I did.
