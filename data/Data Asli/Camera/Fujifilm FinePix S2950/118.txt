This is a great camera. The photos are very high quality and the camera has many great features as well. The zoom is especially useful. The photos came out very clear even on the 18x zoom setting. Very easy to operate and fairly light weight. Though it takes four batteries it lasts quite a long time.The cons are the size, studio USB cord. As far as the size, it is rather large so I have a hard time carrying it around in my handbag without leaving removing some items.Where the studio it came is good, I had troubles installing it at first. I ended up having to re-install it due to issues with opening the studio.The USB cord is pretty short as well. It's the right length but just barely reaches out beyond my hard drive. I have to set the camera on my hard drive or floor rather than on my desk.But overall it is handy camera and very easy to use. Great for amateurs/beginners or hobby-photographers.
