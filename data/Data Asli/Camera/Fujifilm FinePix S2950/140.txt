I like reading reviews, and also it can be bad.. Some people will write the worst reviews about everything, leaving you to be just as skeptical as they are. I am going to tell you the truth.Some of the reviewers are exaggerating, its not so simple to use. I just got it out the box, I automatically knew how to pop open the flash, and how to use auto mode. Everything else you need to read in the manual which is a 'BASIC manual' the fuller more developed manual you will have to download off their website or buy!! I was reading the manual it tells me to go to page 98 and 101 for extended explanation on features, but this manual only consists of around 25 pages!! In 3 languages!There are TONS of features. I turned the light off in my living room, It was pitch dark, I took a pic with the flash, it came out crisp , clear, and bright!! I tested the zoom for blur, it was not blurry at all, still crisp!Love this camera very happy I purchased it and not the NIKKON L120 for that high price. This total cost me $161 was $147 and tax made it $161. May buy more for the family. Refuse to share my own :)
