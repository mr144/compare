I have used film camera since I was 14 and had recently been using digital.  Love the new features.  I have 2 Cannons now.  My wife wanted a simple point and shoot and that is exactly what you get.  I have had this camera 1 month and this is what I found out.  when using the zoom, do not expect the  a crisp shot.  You are going to need a tripod.  When inside using a flash, get within 3 feet and be sure every one or everything is on the same level distance.  Otherwise the person or object in front will be well exposed and everything else will be dark.Outside or in natural lights look great.  Crisp and clean and the sensors do it right.  But again, if you use the zoom lens too far out such as 18X you really need a tripod.In any setting the shutter release has a slight delay so you need to be ready to plan ahead sometimes.It is difficult to use the manual settings.  It takes some time to figure it out such as changing the ISO or shutter speed.Overall it is a good point and shoot but inside flash is weak.
