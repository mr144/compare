I got this camera as a birthday gift from my sister.  I was very excited at first because it has similar features as my Panasonic which I like it very much, and this one even includes a PANORAMA function that I thought was awesome.  However, after I tried it out I found out why it is selling with a much lower price than the other similar models: The indoor shots are of very poor quality (as the other reviewer has mentioned, including the consentaneous comment attached to that review).  The outdoor shots are much better but no way great.I give it a three star for the affordable price, and the very easy-to use panorama function (although it does not always result in a smooth wide-angle looking picture, many times the pictures are connected with obvious kinks).
