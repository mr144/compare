I bought this camera, because i am going to be taking a few vacations this year. I have a regular digital camera, but I wanted something that could really capture the beautiful view I will be experiencing. I am by no means a professional photographer, but I love capturing great moments. When I got the camera, I immediately brought it outside and started doing a photoshoot of my puppy. I wanted to get a handle on all of the available features the camera had to offer. It was very easy to find what you needed, the manual also helps. It's lightweight and takes great pictures! I am very excited to see how my pictures will turn out after the mini vacations throughout the summer!
