With careful use this camera can give very sharp photographs, but only if you watch what you are doing. This is especially true at the extremes of camera's operating range.Telephoto photography requires either a tripod or very short exposures. For example without a tripod a shutter speed of 1/250th is required at 9X, and 1/500th at 18X.Macro photography results in a very limited depth of field (i.e. the distance that a 3D object remainds in focus). Another pitfall of macro photography is the motion of either the object or the camera. A tripod or a very steady hand is required. Using the electronic viewfinder and balance your elbows against your torso will help steady the camera. Pray that there is no wind to move the object.In summary this excellent camera will take excellent photos if used carefully.
