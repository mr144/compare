I wanted a camera for still photography with superior performance to my obsolete 3.5Mp x10 Olympus C-470.  It had to run on AAs for use in the field, have a x10 to x20 zoom, higher res, better dynamic range.  You did think ANYTHING on the market could beat a seven-year-old midrange unit.  Not true.I hoped the Fujifilm Finepix S2950 would fit the bill.  It came highly rated.  It looked like the perfect fit.  I quickly found out it is not. At least I know what the 'S' stands for in the model line- as in piece of...In its defense it has a superb CCD- low noise and high resolution.  It's software is quite sophisticated, yet easy to use.  But its optics are HORRIBLE.  Its images are cloudy- even in the 3' LCD, which shows how bad the images look on a big screen or printed out.  It is not the fault of the autofocus.  There are serious abberations in the lens components that no setting or common tricks could get around.  The images could not be rescued in post processing.My ancient Olympus runs rings around the Fuji S2950.  Luckily the store was good about taking it back.
