I purchased the Fuji S2950 digital camera in the fall of 2011 and as I have had other Fuji digital cameras with fairly long zooms on their point & shoot cameras, I was disapointed with this camera. My intent was to replace my old Fuji S1000 12X optical zoom digital camera with this one, but I cannot as the older S1000 Fuji camera took clearly superiour pictures in all situations....day or in low light situations. I took this new Fuji S2950 camera to several outdoor events and used the 'automatic' mode with no flash as it was broad daylight and the pictures mostly were blurred or 'washed out'....a huge disapointment for me. I had to end up using a much smaller compact Fuji AX300 for my photos for both of those events, even tho the optical zoom on that compact camera was only 5X, their photos turned out much better.If I had to list the pros on this camera, I guess it would be that it is fairly easy to use, has an optical viewfinder, good flash and fairly long zoom. You also get a decent video with this camera in the video mode.Battery life is decent with this camera as it uses 4 'AA' batteries.The only con that I have had with this camera is the poor picture quality in any situation.It's a nice-looking digital camera with a decent zoom and plenty of features on it, but it simply did not live up to my expectations as an ideal replacement for my much older and now gone Fuji S1000 digital camera.If Fuji would have spent a bit more time with getting the camera to take a better picture in the Auto mode, then I would have given this camera a better review.
