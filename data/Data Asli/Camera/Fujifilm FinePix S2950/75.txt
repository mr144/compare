I am a total amateur when it comes to photography, but I wanted something that was a step up from my regular point and shoot digital camera. A lot of my friends are photographers and I would always be jealous of their amazing pictures. I was reluctant to purchase this based on the bad reviews, but I have had great luck with this camera. The pictures look professional, and the flash is incredible. I took some pictures of my friends out at a party last week and the flash lit up the entire room. Everyone wanted their picture taken with my camera. A girl even looked at a picture on my camera's screen and goes 'Are you a professional photographer?' I am so pleased with this camera. Pictures are better when the flash it used-- it is easily the camera's best feature. The zoom is also impressive. The lens cap does fall off too easily sometimes-- be sure to buy a bag for this camera. I did definitely recommend this camera if you are looking for a step up from your regular digital camera.
