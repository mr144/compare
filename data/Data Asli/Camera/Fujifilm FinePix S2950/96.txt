I used this camera both indoors and outdoors, and I thought the image processing was slow, and the amount of light captured by the camera in low light conditions was surprisingly low for a camera this size. In fax, my little Optio performed better in low light with no flash. I also found it had to get the camera to focus on foreground in macro. I ended up selling it back to one of my guys for fifty bucks, because I am on a military installation where I can not mail things back over thirteen ounces. I'll just be spending 400 dollars on a decent camera, like the nice Canon I used to own.
