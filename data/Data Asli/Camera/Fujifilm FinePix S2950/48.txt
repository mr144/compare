I have had mine for about 5 months now and have used it SEVERAL times. Birthdays, holidays, fun photo sessions. Sometimes it takes a few seconds to focus clearly, but if you have read the manual and or played around with the settings, it is fairly easy to figure out. Works best when there's alot of light or with the flash. I really have no complaints about it. It's an excellent deal and an excellent camera.
