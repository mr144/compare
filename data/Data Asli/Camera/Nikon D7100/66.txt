First of all I did not get my Unit from Amazon.When the shopkeeper handed me the Nikon D7100 body I made sure that I got the unit with clean sensor; I snapped my 35mm f1.8G (bought from Amazon)& took few shots of blue sky @ F22 & Lucky enough to have a good perfectly clean sensor, I will be responsible for any ingress of foriegn material to the sensor.Handling is pretty much similar to my former pet; my D7000, few controls were added but I get used to it in no time.Two things that I appreciate after 2 weeks of intermittent test:1. Adding lock on the Mode dial - prevents from accidental change in the setting.2. 51 Points AF system - Improved focusingI do not care much on the low buffer capacity as I am seldom shooting continuously, I havent tested yet the video capability because I am not a big fan of DSLR video with audible sound of lens auto focusing, maybe external mic will improve it, but for the time being I will let my son to take video with his iPhone.I am very plesed with image quality, color rendition and the sharpness although some factors are attributed to the lens, and of course to shooter. There is also significant improvement in Low Light shooting I can produce good acceptable image @ ISO 3200 cleaner than what the D7K is producing.I did not regret my decision to sell my D7K with kit lens and add small amount to have this body. Five star for me does not mean it is a perfect camera, I am satisfied with it as per my shoting requirements and style as advanced enthusiast. I do not mind the other shortcomings of this machine as long as it is not affecting me directly.
