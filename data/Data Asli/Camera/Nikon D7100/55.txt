This is a very nice pro-Sumer DX format body for those wishing to upgrade from older models.  I have several older bodies and was waiting for the features to add up and the prices to drop enough to justify an upgrade. Considered going with an FX format (D600 / D800) but have too many DX lenses to justify leaving the smaller format. This replaces a D300 and a D80 (ok - a D2H also) and adds many features, such as two memory card slots and video! Now it is time to shop for more memory as big picture files require big storage. I added a 17-85mm f2.8 lens to get this camera off to a great start!
