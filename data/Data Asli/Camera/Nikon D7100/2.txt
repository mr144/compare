Ok this is just a brief review i previously own the D7000 which i got a year ago and i love the camera and decided to get the new D7100 mostly because of the new 51 point AF system which is awesome by the way it focus faster even on low light situations. I have been testing both cameras and the quality of the pictures are just about the same the only difference i notice is the D7000 creates much more chromatic aberration the D7100 does not seem to have that problem so if you were looking to get better quality images from this new D7100 i doubt this is the camera for you but if you are looking forward to get excellent AF results this is the camera for you It pretty much inherit the AF system from Nikon's D4 and the D800 which is awesome also the camera feels better in the hand it is more comfortable then the D7000, I also recommend getting the MB-D15 battery grip for this camera cause it is a little more power hungry than the D7000.Also if you are the type of person who's not looking forward to learn how to fully us the camera on Manual mode save some bucks and just go for a D5200 or D3200 you will only get the most out of this camera if you learn how to use it on Manual just saying cause i have read many reviews with people complaining about it.
