Each of my upgrades from the D40x to D90 to D7000 resulted in major improvements in speed/handling and low light performance.A little less so from the D7000 to D7100, but still worth pursuing if the following reasons matter to you.  Otherwise, the D7000 remains a fantastic camera and a great bargain.* The low light focusing is significantly improved.  Where the D7000 would just cycle back and forth, the D7100 usually locks on reliably. 51 vs 39 focus points does not get me too excited.* Have not run the tests yet, but no back-focusing so far.* The resolution of the 24mp sensor without the OLPF is simply fantastic at low ISOs.* Some better channel separation on the stereo mic would have been nice, but performance is adequate overall.  At least I do not have to lug around that separate mic anymore.  The cabling on the outside of the camera is a PITA.* I would reckon the low light performance is better by around a half stop in absolute terms.  But the grain is finer and smoother, so where I would stop at 3200 if possible on the D7000, I am going to 6400 on the D7100 without feeling too dirty.  Family pics, not pro stuff.  Things deteriorate pretty rapidly after that.GRIPES* My first copy had a bad left mic channel.  There seem to be some other QA issues reported here, so I would STRONGLY recommend checking out all the camera functions ASAP after receiving your unit.  2nd copy has been fine so far *knocks wood*.* Still have not figured out how to do Auto ISO on the movie setting.  Adjusting manually for now.  Guess I should read the manual.Otherwise, I feel right at home with D7100, having used the D7000 since shortly after its release.I was considering the D600 heavily as well, but decided to stick with DX because I LIKE the 1.5x crop factor -- it gives a little extra reach and you are using only the sweet spot of FX lenses.  I also wanted the stereo mic and did not like the whole D600 oil spot issue.  Will see how the D7100 sensor holds up.I was going to wait for the D400, but wanted to have the best possible pics for a major family vacation.  Pretty happy with the purchase so far.The 24-70/2.8 stays on my camera 95% of the time.  Man I love that lens.I use the 70-200/2.8 sometimes for sports.  CRAZY sharp lens, but a beast to handle.On a side note, the way Nikon handled the whole comfort women uproar was disappointing and infuriating.  They totally caved to the imperialist pigs.  Really made me want to jump to Canon, but they did eventually hold the exhibition after a court order.  I also really dislike the Canon ergonomics.[...]
