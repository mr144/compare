Pictures from Nikon D7100 are ... beautiful.  They are very sharp in details even in low light.  Anyway, there may be enough posts of positive things about Nikon D7100.  This post is about unusual  something seen in Nikon D7100's RAW images ...1.  RAW images were always captured at 12-bit (lossless compressed RAW 12-bit) even though the camera was set at lossless compressed 14-bit2.  RAW image's size was always at 1620x1080 @12-bit no matter which Image Quality option was chosen (NEF+JPEG fine, NEF+JPEG normal, NEF+JPEG basic, NEF)3.  JPEG images were recorded at 6000x4000 @8-bit (Large)I used latest Nikon Capture NX2 version 2.4.1 and Nikon View NX2 version 2.0.2RAW images from Nikon D7000 were reported correctly using these same Nikon Capture/View NX2 software.  In other words, D7000's raw images were properly recorded at 4928x3264 (L), lossless compressed RAW 14-bitHave anyone seen/had this problem with Nikon D7100?I wonder if my D7100 were a defected one.  I bought mine brand new from local Best Buy store.Besides these weird issues (and I hope I can get answers/solution soon), I love this new camera, and I strongly recommend it to everyone
