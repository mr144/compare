I will not give up my D7000 but now I have two FX and two DX bodies. It most comfortable with a smaller profile and a small learning curve. And the photos/photo files are top shelf. Mine spit oil on the sensor already but ZI have come to accept that happening as it not limited to Nikon cameras and the entire industry needs to address this problem and do a bit of preventative engineering.
