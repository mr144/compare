Background:I have been shooting Nikon and Other Brands DSLRS for Several Years.I own several Prime and Zoom Lens of both High End and Lower End, and I never leave my home without a camera in my hand. Now that we have established that I know how to use a Camera we can move on.Since I was looking to upgrade from a D7000 to a D7100, this will be mainly D7000 VS D7100. I will not get into comparing them with the D600 FX.Having a D7000 I have been a big fan of Nikon for years and I was looking forward having a D7100. I spent about 2 weeks looking at reviews all over the internet, comparing, and comparing, until I decided to finally purchase the D7100.Out of the BoxFirst thing I noticed was that it feels of cheaper build than the D7000, and that the shutter release also did not feel or sounded as smooth as I had hoped. I just did not get the feeling that I was using a better version of my D7000.Also there were Oil Marks on the camera out of the box. :( (If you are not comfortable doing wet cleaning, this might be a big issue for you)Shooting /Image Quality I had to shoot JPG for two main reasons, 1) No RAW support at the time 2) In-Camera HDR only works with JPG.Out of the box photos taken with the D7100 look sharper but also grainer in comparison with the D7000 Even at Low ISOs. YES even at Low ISO. (I did not want to believe this, since I really wanted to like the D7100)I liked the HDR feature, since I could have an OK HDR picture in seconds to share it on the Internet. However, I wanted to get natural looking pictures, but I usually ended up with pictures looking like a Beginner's Photoshop Homework, but I really hope this was just me, since I want this feature to work properly on this or future Nikon cameras.Focusing/PointsThe 51 Focusing points were very nice to use, especially at the 1.5 X Cropped modes, but nothing really worth the update from a D7000. (This does not give your lens extra reach precisely, it just means the picture is cropped, allowing you to use only the juicy part of your lens and to shoot faster)I must say that I did not get any back or front focusing, but also did not get that great improvement that I was hoping for in the D7100, in fact a few times while shooting, the camera would not focus fast enough.Pros D710051 Focusing PointsIn-Camera HDRMore Mega PixelsSharper ImagesCons D7100Grainer PhotosBuild Quality could be an Issue. (Oil Marks, Cheaper Feel, etc.)(I hope I just had a Bad Apple)ConclusionI will probably be repeating what I have read many times before, but I had to experience it myself first hand to really get it.If you have a D7000, you already have a great camera, use the money to get better lens, probably even go FX. (I hate to say this since I really wanted to keep the D7100)If you are coming from anything lower than a D7000 and you have the extra few dollars to burn, the D7100 is a good option, although probably getting the D7000 and maybe a 50mm 1.8G and/or a 35mm 1.8G would be a better choice.Note:I have returned my D7100, and decided to wait for maybe a newer version of the D600 FX.I believe that if you are looking for something above the d7000 you will have to go Full Frame to really see a huge difference on your everyday shooting.
