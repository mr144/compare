Different cameras obviously but coming from the D90 to the D7100 proved to be such a significant improvement in many ways I felt compelled to add a 5 star for Nikon.  I am not going to write a long review because many have said what I know and feel about this camera so I'll save you the redundancy.  I will say that I do not agree that this is not for the newbie to photography.  If you have the money and you really want to invest some time learning the art I think this is probably the best choice.  Excellent build quality, ISO performance, shutter speed, sharpness with the filter less sensor etc.  Some of what turns many new photographers off is the inability to take great photos and camera with the capability of the 7100 helps a great deal.  I will also say that lenses are the other half of the equation if not more than the body and I can also tell you that my 18-200 VRII and few other lenses never took images as good as on the D90 as on the D7100.  So, I am starting to ramble and I'll cut myself off here.  I suggest thinking about what you really want to accomplish and what your budget is and if the 7100 fits then go for it.NOTE: Photo's do not show well on the Amazon site, actual images are much better.  They must be compressed to save space.  Also note that I made a mistake on one photo I listed the lens used as 18-200VRll and it is actually the 70-300VRll
