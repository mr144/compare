Such crisp photographs. I went from the Nikon D80 to the D7100 and notice a HUGE difference in quality of my photos (especially with it is image processor and 24Megapixels). Plus great features like Active D-Lighting and High definition dynamic range. You can see both your clouds and your low light areas in the same picture. I have also noticed that is does a much better job with low-light photos, much lower &#34;noise&#34; than my D80. The D7100 also has 51 Auto-Focus points. I can action put the focus point where I actually want it to be.  I also like that all my D80 lenses fit my D7100 body. I do not have to start over with lenses. I am very happy with my upgrade!
