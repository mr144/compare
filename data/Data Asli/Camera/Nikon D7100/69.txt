In one word, all that I can say is that this is AWESOME. Being my first digital SLR, I have not made a bad decision. It produces some great pictures with a lot of easy to use functional components (without having to get into the menu). The menu system that this camera comes with is not the best (but I think it is pretty decent). I have used Canon systems before (to give Canon some credit, it was a couple generations old and about an entry level camera) you had to go to the menu to get a lot done; not the case with the D7100, however the Canon menu system seemed a lot more user friendly. Not a big deal, a couple of thousand shutters later, I have learnt a good deal to be able to get good pictures from this camera.The camera feels solid in your hand (I have large sausage fingers, but it is still works great) -- The front does not feel as good when you are holding to take some photos, but if you are just holding the camera, it feels perfect.Overall such a great product, I would recommend this to anyone who is serious about getting into photography, yes, even if it is weekend photography at your friend's place.
