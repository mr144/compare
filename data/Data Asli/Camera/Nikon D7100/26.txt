I use D7000, and jump to D7100 when it is available, for one reason: Video Shooting! It has (that D7000 does not): Audio Meter, Headphone Jack, Stereo Mic, 50i/60i at full HD (1920X1080).But after use it for several weeks, this is additional things that I found useful:1. 1.3 crop. This is amazing feature that I use more and more often now. Especially when using my Nikon 50mm F.14G, and Tokina 11-16mm F2.8. I program the Image Area (1.3X 18Mp or DX 24mp), into Fn button, so I can switch them without leaving my eye from viewfinder. Why I need this? To make my 50mm lens become 65mm lens. Or making my 11-16mm become 14-20mm. Fantastic...! Now my Tokina 11-16mm becoming more 'portrait' friendly.2. Auto-focus. No surprise, the auto-focus is much better than D7000. It is more consistent, and little bit faster. And also perform slightly better in low light.3. 24Mpix. This is actually has a mixed result. On 24Mpix (DX Image Area, see point 1), it becomes noticeably slower (I always shoot RAW uncompressed + Jpeg Fine). On the other hand, at 18Mpix (1.3 Crop) it is snappier and comparable to D7000 in terms of speed/response.4. Image quality: I find it a little bit better than D7000, but not really impressing like jumping from D100 to D200, or D200 to D300, or D300 to D3S.The cons:At 24Mpix (DX mode), it becomes slower. And when I need to preview the Image, it take some times to response (not like D7000 which is snap). I do not have a chance to test it with fastest SD card (90MB/s). I only use SanDisk Extreme 45MB/s. Probably, when I use a 90MB/s SD card, and split NEF in slot 1 and JPG in slot 2, the response will be much faster.Conclusion:For me, it is a really worth the upgrade, but probably not applicable to any other person with different requirement.
