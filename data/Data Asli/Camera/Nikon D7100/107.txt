Currently using a Nikon D90. Just received my D7100 two days ago. The quibbles - files are so large when using maximum quality (RAW + JPEG) that it takes a long time to write from the card to the computer. Copying, editing, moving, even uploading files from camera using View NX2 or Nikon Transfer has become a long process even using Class 10 and SDXC cards.Now the other side. I thought I got really good pictures from the D90. The pictures from the D7100 are GREAT. The technology of removing the filter from the sensor not only makes the picture incredibly sharp, I have not had any issues with the moire all the reviews warn about as a possibility. In short the D7100 is a whole new world of photography. Setting up all of the defaults to your individual specifications and designating control functions to specific buttons takes a bit of time initially, but the results make it a great investment of time.Still getting accustomed to the all of the possibilities the camera provides. Combined with the new Nikkor 18-300 lens it is a relatively heavy assembly. Again, worth it in every respect. Nikon can rightly claim this as a flagship DX until they top it with something else in the future.Ca not speak for professionals and really advanced enthusiasts, but for the rest of us. WOW !!!
