I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of my D7100, hopeful that it would be OK without any of the focus or other issues etc. that the D7000 had and so far I am blown away.  I have spent the last several days putting it through the paces and it has exceeded my expectations.  The handling and ergonomics are superb.  The pictures are sharp and the color excellent.  It is solid, fits my hand well and the controls are intuitive and well laid out.The focus is right on, exposure is accurate,  I still use exposure compensation but that's more a personnel preference in how I want my pictures to look. This camera has all the tools that any serious photographer needs and then some.  If you have a passion for photography and want control of all aspects of your photography then this is the camera for you.  If you are more of a point & shoot person then the D3200 or D5200 might serve you better. They both take super pictures.  This is the last DSLR I will buy, as I am 70 years old, and I expect this camera to meet all my needs for years to come.  My only other camera purchase will be the Fujifilm x100s for when I do not want the bulk or weight of a DSLR.
