I went to my local camera shop today and i took my super sharp rokinon 85mm and the $1500 dollar nikkor 17-55, i shot the D7000 and the D7100 with both my lenses, i also took two of my SD cards and installed one in each of the cameras, i set them both the same way, i have seen the photos on my monitor and i am sincerely NOT seeing any difference, plain and simple. Wheather this D7100 is used in RAW or jpeg the other cameras are just as good, less expensive and some are even sharper.  I owned the D7000 for three years, which i sold not too long ago, so i also have THOUSANDS of photos taken from that camera.  From all the fuss that's going around i thought the D7100 was WAY BETTER and i was almost ready to buy one.I really wonder how many people here are actually nikon sales people, honestly, and that to me is REALLY REALLY disturbing. If they are not marketting employees they sure are nikon fanboys. I like nikon but if i get to the point where i start telling lies or imagine that a camera is better when is not, now that would mean that there is something wrong with me. The AF of the D7100 is FANTASTIC for sure, but IQ i think people are just wanting to imagine things that are actually not true, specially when i see a recent review for the D7100 that says that the D7100 BLOWS the D7000 away. That's just plain RIDICULOUS. I have owned D200, D7000, Fuji S5 PRO and have used a D300 and own many nikon lenses and i would definitely see a big difference in IQ from the D7100 compared to most these cameras, but the D7100 is only a hair better in picture quality between the D7000, which right now you can buy the D7000 at a BARGAIN price.Now that i have finished my comment, all of you can start saying 'well, did you buy the camera???' 'Your review is pointless and useless and invalid since you did not buy the camera'.
