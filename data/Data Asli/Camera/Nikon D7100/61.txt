I first bought the d3200, nope sent it back. Then got the d5200 and was quite surprised how much different that camera was compared to the 3200, I almost kept the d5200, but there was a couple things I was not happy with but could have lived with. So I returned the d5200, and preordered the d7100, had about a month wait, but well worth it. This camera is bigger than either one of the other two, which fits my hands much better, the ownerers manual is 3/4 of an inch thick compared to maybe an 1/8 inch thick on the d5200. The best thing I like is this model has two thumb wheels, one on the back of the camera right above where your thumb will naturally go, and one just below the shutter button where your index finger will naturally be, so you can use the back one to adjust shutter, and the front to set aperature, this makes it extremely easy to use in manual mode, so easy in fact I almost always shoot this way,. With the 5200 you onlyhad one wheel on the back so to adjust shutter you had to use the same wheel fr adjusting aperature plus push another button to switch from aperature adjust to shutter adjust, all three cameras are completely different in many respects in my opinion, not just added features, the d7100 other than processing power really is a completely different camera, I love it, very Happy. I use this camera both commercially as well as just plain fun. I am so glad I opted to upgrade from the d5200, but if your a woman or fairly new to dslr's, you may find the d5200 a better fit for yoyr hand and its lighter, These issues were not a concern for me and this camera fits my hand much better, and is definitly a more professional camera in every respect, their is a vety goid reason the owners manual is so thick! Love this camera.
