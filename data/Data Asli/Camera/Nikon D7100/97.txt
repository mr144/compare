The new D7100 is NOT a replacement for a D7000 - it is a whole new beast! I am glad I waited until this new camera was available. It is in good company with my D300s. I bought this as my backup body but in the short time I have used it, I am really impressed. If you have read any of my other reviews, you did know I am a huge Nikon fan and have been shooting with their cameras for over 40 years. I am also a huge fan of the DX format.The D7100 has a couple of features not available on the D300s. At first I thought it was a dumbed down D300s, but after shooting a couple hundred images with every lens that I own, I am finding that some of the features are very useful. In particular, it has the ability of cropping the image area to a 1.3X factor. Simply put, a 300mm DX lens becomes a 390mm lens. I have been using my Nikkor 80mm to 400mm AF ED lens and since it is an FX format lens it becomes a 120mm to 600mm and when you use the 1.3X crop function it maxes out at 780mm!The new features are many, but the ones I like the best include the display of the virtual horizon thru the viewfinder, auto focus in live view mode, the 1.3X crop function and the ability to shoot 6-fps! The fast frame rate is only possible when using an extreme SDHC card. The D7100 has 2 SDHC card slots, so you can record RAW on the first card and JPEG on the second. OR, you can create backup copies (as you shoot) on the second card. Nice!Now for the down side - it only shoots RAW and JPEG - unlike the D300s which will also shoot TIF's. The second &#34;gotcha&#34; is the RAW processing, version 7.4, is not out yet! Yes, Adobe has a BETA you can download, but I have not been able to make it work. I am sure they will get it together before long. The other thing that surprised me was a long list of &#34;Program&#34; modes - 18 of them! That's where the dumbed down aspects come in. I guess if you are looking for simplicity...it is there! OK, now back to the really good features...The LCD screen is the brightest and sharpest I have seen on any camera! Nikon came up with a new way to display things - RGB+W. That's right, Red, Green, Blue and White. Also they have added 2 user defined settings to the mode dial. Let's say you want to shoot B&W, you can program that for &#34;U1&#34; and maybe HDR, &#34;U2&#34;. Very handy! There is one additional item on the menu which is really great - &#34;Recent Settings&#34; - finally, you can have a look at your latest set of changes! Very useful addition.I'll be adding to this review as I use the camera more. This is clearly a versitile addition to the Nikon lineup...it can be set to &#34;easy&#34; or worked like a pro.
