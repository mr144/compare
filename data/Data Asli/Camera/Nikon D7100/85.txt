Review coming from a ex Canon user.  I have been seeing Nikon specs beating Canon lately and when this camera was announced I knew I was getting it.  Aside from the D600 dust/oil debacle Nikon has been steadily beating Canon.  With the D7100 you get a lot of features for your money.  The main reasons I chose this over a comparable Canon model are the auto focus system and sensor image quality.  Hopefully Canon will put out something amazing with the 70D and 7d MK II.  Get this camera, you will be happy. D7100 is the best camera ever.
