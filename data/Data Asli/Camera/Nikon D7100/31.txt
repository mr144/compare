This is a fantastic camera. I love the quality of the images, AND the video. Well done Nikon.One issues with image processing however. Of the two software packages I use to manage and edit my images, Adobe Lightroom and Apple's Aperture, to date only Lightroom can process the RAW images. I am not sure why it take these companies so long to update their software to accommodate new cameras.
