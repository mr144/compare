I have had the D7100 for about a week now, and I have been very pleased with the images.  Sharpness is excellent when using the Nikon 16-85 and the Micro 40mm F 2.8.  I owned 2 D7000's, sold them and bought a D600 and this D7100.  It's a nice DX/FX set-up that suits my shooting style.  I highly recommend this D7100, especially when paired with the 16-85 zoom.  Thanks for reading.
