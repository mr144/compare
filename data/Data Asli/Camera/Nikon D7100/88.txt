I will have to admit to Amazon, I did NOT purchase this camera body through you. It was out of stock and my local camera shop had it, so... I have been learning and using it for about two weeks now and the controls are getting 'friendly' with me.Meaning: read the manual cover to cover with the camera in your lap. Preform the function as you read it in the manual, to get some sort of  amuscle-memory'. After a very short learning curve, the camera controls become intuitive. I have fairly large hands and this body fits like it was made for me. The weight/balance is perfect, as well.Growing into all this camera can accomplish will take years, no matter what the 'pros',(being a former film pro myself), say. I LOVE the DX format for some unknown reason, but that is fine with me ie; up-tick in magnification. Options, dynamics and versatility are just some of the 'pros' going for this body. I could go over the list of functions like some reviewers, but will leave you to do your own homework, if you are serious enough about purchasing the D7100. Yes, the price is up there, but you get: weather and dust seals, in body focusing motor, 1/8000 sec. shutter, larger LCD view screen along with Nikon's reputation, quality and service.Some are complaining the LCD view screen does not swing out, like the D5100/D5200. Do not want it, do not need it. I own the D5100 and I am always afraid of breaking the screen off, so I keep it in the body all of the time, as it is rather 'spindly'. You'll want to purchase view screen protectors for the back and top LCD control screens. There were not any available when I bought it, so I purchased iPhone 4 protector screens. Cut one down for both screens. Very economical.If you want a camera body you can use and grow with for years & years to come...GET THIS ONE!
