Upgrading from my old tank D7000 to such a great camera. This camera works perfectly regarding focusing in a very bad light conditions. The 24 MP captures a lot of details. I enjoyed too much the 1.3x extra cropping option (works as a digital zoom actually).Waiting for a firmware upgrade to fix some - minor - issuesThis is an amazing camera!I do recommend it for users who want to upgrade from D90, D7000, ...etc
