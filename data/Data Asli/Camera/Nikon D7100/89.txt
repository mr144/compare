Upgraded from D90 which I will still keep because it was my baby. The D7100 is a beast. FX is not for me since I like telephotos and macro. Already tried my Sigma 150-500mm OS HSM and....man....the images rock in detail as compared to the D90. The removal of the low-pass filter definitely makes a noticeable improvement, contrary to what others have said. Also tried it with the Nikon 70-200 VR and pictures are just beautiful and sharp, great color and very low noise at higher ISO (up to 1600). When I need wide-angle I still feel OK with my Sigma 10-20, I think this lens gives you colors off the camera that most times make you not want to do anything in post-production. With the primes 35mm, 50mm and 85mm results were also superb. Decided to postpone the idea of FX, quite honestly do not think I will ever purchase one, in my opinion it is less useful for most consumer or enthusiast needs.
