but not my favorite apsc dslr. I was a little surprised at the noise on some of the images even at iso 1600. My old K-5 (not the II or IIs version) did much better in similar lighting conditions. That said the Nikon has a lot of features and is a good value. I was expecting a cheaper version of my d600, but this camera is not that.
