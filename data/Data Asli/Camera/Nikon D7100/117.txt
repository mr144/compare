I purchased this to replace my Canon 7D. Considering this is newer and has the OLPF removed, I expected better quality. What I got instead was a generic DSLR camera. Yes it shoots nice photos but so do $500 DSLRs littering the market. I have no idea why this camera has been hyped to the max. My 7D shot incredible magazine quality photos, straight out of the box, on full auto. This camera can not even match the quality of the 7D, forget about surpassing it. I really wanted to switch over to Nikon but all that counts ultimately is image quality and this camera is just another one in the bunch. Nothing stands out. You can see some sample images I uploaded. They are point and shoot jpg's without any processing or filters. You can see that it is a basic DSLR camera. Why does it cost so much? Unjustified price for this level of performance. Lame.I gave it two stars instead of one because it does have some technical 'wows' such as megapixel count, shots per second, etc. etc. but why does that matter when the picture itself is generic quality you can get in a cheap DSLR? When you look at a picture, do you ask 'Wow! I wonder how many shots per second were used or the exact f-stop setting to capture this image?' No. You either like the photo or you do not. I do not like what I see from the images from this camera. Not at this price.
