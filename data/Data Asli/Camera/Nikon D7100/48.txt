After a month, about 1,500 photos and 2 hours of video, I can say my new Nikon D7100 overall is a nice step up from my old D300 (purchased in Dec2007).  The D7100 is smaller and lighter than the D300 plus the D7100 shoots video.  While it is video capabilities cannot touch my wife's Sony HDR-CX550V digital video camera, the D7100 is far more convenient to use versus lugging around both the D300 and HDR-CX550V.  The D7100 will AF in live view video mode, something that I do not believe Canon digital SLR cameras will do.D7100 vs. D300:  D7100 has the same to faster autofocus speed and sensitivity, better image quality, the same to better color, and metering accuracy is about the same or slightly better than the D300.  Both the D7100 and D300 suffer from a small memory buffer - in high speed frame advance (6 fps) the buffer fills and slow down about 2-3 fps after 7 or 8 consecutive shoots.  At 4 fps or slower, I can shoot to my hearts content with the D7100.  I do not really care for the D7100's user customizable banks, as they are limited to only two.  The D300 has several user customizable banks, but they are accessible only through the camera's menu system (call this a stalemate).  The D300 is more ruggedly constructed than the D7100, and several key camera functions are quicker and easier to set than on the D7100 (i.e., AF mode, metering, ISO, white balance).  I love the dual SDXC card slots of the D7100 and hate the CF cards for the D300.  The D7100 has better battery life than the D300 (but the D7000 battery life beats both).I am concerned that the D7100 lacks the rear LCD screen protector that the D300 (and D7000) have.  I can see Nikon eliminating the screen protector on a tilt / swivel LCD screen, and / or a touch screen, but the D7100 has neither of these.  What gives here?Overall, so far so good.
