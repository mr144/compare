I purchased my second new Nikon which is the D7100, and this camera was a long time coming. I would have bought the D7000 but it did not have the headphone jack and i like to monitor what i am hearing. This camera has all the stuff the higher priced cameras have but at a much lower price. Super Satisfied!! The order came complete and secured. very happy with my purchase!!
