After many years with D80, and skipping the D90 and D7000 I decided to upgrade.The D7100 is more than the pixels. The ISO is big step forward. I can shoot indoors without flash and get nice results with my 40/2.8 lens.The  camera feels like a pro level camera and the photos are big step up from D80. I am very happy with the upgrade, and with the fact that I did not compromise for the D5200.
