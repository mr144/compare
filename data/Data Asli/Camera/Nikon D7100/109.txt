I will be honest and give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I just got my camera on March 24th and I give it 4 stars for the test shots that I have made and getting to know how the camera works.  I tested my kit lenses of 18-55mm and55-200mm.  I am well pleased with the images and they are better than the Nikon D5100.  I briefly got the chance to evaluate all photos in CS 5.  When I took test shots on my 50mm f1.8, of course they were sharper.  I will have to do some more testing tomorrow so I can post them.  Since it is still winter (groundhog got it wrong) colors will look mundane so I will try my best for some decent shots.Auto focus extremely fast.  It is one of the things I like about the camera.  I took test shots of planes flying overhead and in standard auto focus, not the tracking auto focus, the camera tracked the airplane from a good distance and also on approach.If you own the Nikon D5100, the menu is similar and the camera is very easy to set up.As far as in other reviews where people have said they do not like where the buttons are set up, I cannot relate, but where the buttons are, just fine for me.One interesting thing that I liked about the camera is that is has an additional 1.3 crop which can be set up in the camera menu.  This 1.3 crop actually zooms in on the subject/object without myself adjusting the lens.  Would be great for sports and event photography which is what I want to get into.Camera is a good buy.  Sometimes to make money, have to invest money.  Camera is worth the investment.  I will try to post images later.  Cheers.
