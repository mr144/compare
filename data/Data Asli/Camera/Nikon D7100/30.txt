My last camera was a D80. I have tried D3100 and 5200. Good cameras, good images, but they do not feel like a real camera for people like me that has being shooting since manual film cameras.I love images 7100 produces and responsiveness and interface.Good options to adjust the camera to your own preferences, allowing fast access to main and common functions.The manual is good (read it!) and I also use the iphone version.Until now a just miss a easy way to interface with IPhone and sync info like GPS geo and time data.
