I bought this SLR to replace my D300. There is no comparison when it comes to resolution and low light capabilities: The D7100 is 10 steps ahead. I used the camera on a recent trip to Central America with my 28-200, 70-200, and 105 macro. Many of the shots were taken in low light at higher ISO's in the coastal and central rain forests. The photos are phenomenal! The one negative is the small buffer size which limits the number of photos taken at a time to about 6-7 at high speed. This therefore would not be such a great camera for speed sports such as alpine ski racing, cycling, or motor sports.
