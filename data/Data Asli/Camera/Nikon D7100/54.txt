Gave this 5 stars because I could not give 4.5 stars and think it deserves more than 4.  I am not a professional by any means, just a hobby-amateur photographer who wants decent quality photos.  I am also not a pixel counter or zoom in umpteen % like others seem to do.  I like some control to learn and further my ability but also appreciate the auto/scene modes.  That said, this is an excellent camera and in my opinion a good value given the build with weather sealing. I chose the body only and tested it so far with the 16-85mm lens I already have. The few tests I have done have produced excellent images but I have not enough video yet. The locking dial did take a little getting used to but I guess it has its advantage. I am sure I will learn to appreciate all the control buttons/dials. The screen resolution is outstanding.  A touch screen would be nice to navigate the menu options but not critical for me.  I had the D5200 for a week but ended up sending it back, not due to quality but the fact that it was sent as new and had obviously been used. After much self-debating, I decided to go a step up with the D7100, and glad I did. The shutter noise seems to be quieter, which I like. I am not a fan of the articulating screen so not having that is not an issue, but may be for some. It is heavier but that would be expected with the better build. There is no comparison in the build quality between the 5200 and 7100, although I found the 5200 to be exceptional in image quality too!  I like that you can have two SD cards in the camera to have one exclusively for video or backup/overflow. I know I have some learning to do so may update this review at a later date. I do not go into great technical details as I see in some review, so anyone wanting that should read the Dpreview.com in depth review, along with the many other reviews out there if they are seriously considering this.
