Just came back from a 2 week photo journey using this camera all day - it meets or exceeds my expectations in every way. But, most importantly of all (and admittedly subjectively), the sharpness and clarity of the photos seem to exceed any of my previous dSLRs (D2X, D300, D7000) - maybe it is the removal of the anti-aliasing filter, maybe it is the 24 MP, (although I did like to say it is my technique (not)), but the image quality just is mind blowing. The focusing is faster than the others-I guess due to Expeed 3. The menu system is similar to the D7000: so customizable, it will suit virtually anyone's needs. My only minor complaint is that, with the larger files sizes, the camera's buffer fills after 3 quick shots (in RAW) and one must wait (momentarily) for the camera to write to the card. (I have ordered and await the fastest possible cards and I advise this for all-they are pricey). The 1080 p 30 fps video is stunning. I highly recommend this camera - it is the best one I have ever used by far.
