This is a huge improvement over my D90.  I do not have the time nor the space to go through the differences between the two models.  For that you can find plenty of camera\photo sites to get a great review. My main concern with writing this review is to confirm that the D7100 is a great camera and that any D90 users that are on the fence about upgrading should not hesitate.
