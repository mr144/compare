I grew up with Zenith 12xp (still have it :), few years back I shot Nikon N70 panorama, recently I decided to go back to the hobby and purchased D7000 + 35mm/f1.8. I loved the feel and functionality of the D7000 and as soon as I have learned about D7100, I pre-ordered it on Amazon + 50mm/f1.8 + 85mm/f1.8. I am not a professional or even a good amateur but I have noticed immediately problems with autofocus. In low light conditions, straight out of the box in full auto mode, camera would 'hunt' constatly to focus with my new 1.8G prime lenses. In good light conditions camera would 'freeze' after 1st shot and hesistate before 2nd shutter accentuation (focus on the same stationary object). In addition, autofocus was very loud. I have never experienced this problems with D7000/ never had to fine tuned it. Overall, D7100 feels great in the hands and quality of the pictures is astonishing. Portrait pictures of my German shepherd taken with D7100 + 85mm/f1.8 are superb. I am hoping, I have received bad copy and awaiting for the replacement from Amazon.
