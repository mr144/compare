After several months of saving I upgraded from the Nikon D3100 to the D7100. I am a photography student and knew I needed to upgrade sooner or later. I wanted the abilities of a full frame, but could not quite afford it (D600, $2,000). I read Ken Rockwell's review, comparing the D600 and the D7100. The D600 obviously had advantages, but surprisingly the D7100 won. It had more focusing points and a better auto focusing system for only half the price. I got the D7100 as well as the 85 mm f/1.8 and I absolutely love this camera. It's sturdy, has weather proof sealing, two SD card slots, bracketing, and an improved auto focusing system from the D7000. This camera is said to be, by several online reviews, better than the praised Cannon 60D. This is an amazing buy and for $1200 it is a bargain!!See samples at emilyturnerphoto.com
