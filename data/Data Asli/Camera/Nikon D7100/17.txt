This was my replacement for a 10 year old Nikon D40x which was my replacement for a 10 year old Pentax P30T, both of which I adore. It seems the camera gods are with me again and there is a lot to learn with the extra features I now have but I adore this camera already. Here's to another happy 10 years.
