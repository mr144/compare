I am not a professional.  I moved up from D-70 to D90 to D-7100.I like the performance of the 7100. It produces wonderful images beyond my expectations in low light.  BUT, On page 75 of the user manual, there is a call-out at the bottom that contains the following sentence: 'The focus point for AF is selected automatically; manual focus selection is NOT available.' This really bugs me.  I like being able to manually adjust the focus point to get a light reading on the highlights to keep from blowing them out.  The auto selection of focus point keeps jumping all around with each half-way press of the shutter button. So I am left with having to move to the manual switch, take a light reading from a single point, set my exposure and then switch back to automatic and compose the shot.  It's a bit of a drag and yesterday, I found myself taking my trusty D90 along and leaving the 7100 behind. Perhaps there is a better way, but right now, being new to the camera, I have not discovered it and find it a bit frustrating - hence the 4 stars.  Were it not for the magnificent images it produces at 24mp, I would have given it a 3.
