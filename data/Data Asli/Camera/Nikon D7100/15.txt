Everything you could want in a current technology DX-format DSLR. The 24 Mpixel sensor is outstanding. To get the most out of this camera, you need to know what you are doing. If you are an experienced photographer, this camera can do pretty much anything you might want to do. If you want a point-and-shoot DSLR, this camera is perhaps not for you--it is aimed at knowledgable enthusiasts.The sensor, metering, and autofocus technology has come a long way from the D100 which it replaced. To get the most out of the sensor, you will need good glass, not the bottom-end kit lenses, although even with the bottom-end Nikon lenses you will be able to make terrific images with this camera. My D100 lens collection works just fine on this camera, thanks to camera AF drive. So you can use both older screw-type AF lenses or the more modern AFS lenses.The D3200 or D5200 uses the same sensor if you do not need all the pro features and 51-point AF. (I got along with a single point or 5-point D100 for 10 years.). But if you want the best of the best in the DX line, this is it for now (May 2013).
