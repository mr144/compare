I upgraded from a D5100. I selected the D7100 over the D5200 mostly because I wanted the larger view finder (I rarely use the LCD for framing up a shot, and tend not to do videos with my SRL as I have a pretty decent video camera that does a better job of that). I tested out the camera with the same lenses as my current, and if definitely is better performer.  But I have has some issues.  I recently did a week long vacation to Utah national parts and tooks ~3500 photos.  The camera would frequently lock up, and either be hung up for 15-30 seconds, or longer in which I would turn camera off then back on to bring back to life (that never happened with my D5100).  Also, I do not like having to push a release button down to turn the program mode wheel.  I do not know why they need to lock the wheel since I never had my D5100 accidentally move to another  program setting. The D7100 design requires me to use 2 hands to hand programs modes or release, which is a pain.  I guess they had to do this because the put the wheels on top top of the other and it is hard to get to one without touching the other.  I found the D5100 much easier and fast to change programs.  I have also has a little bit of issue with the camera body recognizing lenses.  I never that that problem with the same lenses on my D5100.  I had a few problems on this recent trip, where I had to remove lens and reattach.  In hindsight, I am thinking I should have gone for the D5200 and save some money.  I am still overall satisfied with the camera (and the faster shutter speed definitely was a plus on recent trip), when you upgrade, I expect to all pluses and no minuses, and there are some minuses for m.
