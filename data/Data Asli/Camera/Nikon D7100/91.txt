Great camera. 1st purchased copy of D7001 had 5 oil spot (not dust) visible at f/16, f/22. Unable to clear with rocket blower and built in cleaner option. Returned. Amazon kind enough to send me a replacement. Replacement now has left focus issue like D800. Not as tack sharp at 100% enlargement as center, upper, lower, right focus points. Others have reported similar issue. Good news is that good copies exist without these problems.I used my 24-70 mm Nikon, f/2.8 lens using high contract focus chart on tripod wide open to test focusing. Amazon is great, but poor quality control from Nikon. I was hoping this camera would be different from known oil on sensor problem of D600. Furthermore, JPEG images more grainy than D7000. But focus system improved. Not a real issue since RAW images can be improved with PP with Lightroom 4.4. Hoping next replacement copy will have no oil spots, L focus problems. Crossing my fingers.
