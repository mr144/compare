I love the camera.  I use with f/16-85mm Nikkor and 50mm f/1.8 prime lens. Amazing sharp pictures.with 50mm very nice bokeh and very sharp images. If you need sharp images and colors do not use auto settings. Do not wast your time comparing with other manufactures. Nikon Camera and Nikkor lens may be little expansive than competitors, but it price for reason.
