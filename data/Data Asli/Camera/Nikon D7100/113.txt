I have only had my D7100 for a day but my family would argue I have not put it down since I brought it home.  All technical stuff aside, this camera takes incredible pictures.  I spent the afternoon experimenting with several DX lenses and the results were just fantastic.  About an hour before sunset the moon was up in the eastern sky so I slapped on my telephoto and took a shot. I was not expecting a lot but when I moved the picture over to my computer and zoomed in on the moon it looked like I took a picture with a telescope!  The lunar landscape was incredibly clear. Beginner or seasoned veteran this camera is a fantastic choice.My first Nikon was a D70 which is still a fantastic camera.  Recently a friend upgraded from a D3100 to a D600 so he cut me a deal on the D3100 which I really enjoyed playing with.  The 3100 is a great starter camera for those looking to ease there way in to the DSLR world.  But having used the D70 for years it felt a bit too light and small for my taste.  If you are hanging on to your D70 or D90 go ahead, make the leap.  The D7100 is a fantastic successor to my D70.
