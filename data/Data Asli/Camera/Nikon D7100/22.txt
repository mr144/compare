This camera will make you more than happy if you like strong colors, great versatility and the fact that it is weatherproof.I just finished using it to photograph a major event in the rain, it performed flawlessly under these conditions, if you know anything about digital equipment , they do not like really bad weather, I can also say the color produced by this camera is amazing. It also performs well in the studio.
