Performing as expected so far. I upgraded from a digital point and shoot. I used to use an SLR film camera and finally decided it was time to get a digital SLR.  So far so good, I am still learning the ropes on this camera. The HD video is great from fixed recording, it will be awkward to use this while moving around.
