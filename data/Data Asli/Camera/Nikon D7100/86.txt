I love it.  We are finally upgrading from our beloved, rock solid D70s that's been around the world with us and shot tens of thousands of photos.  The new D7100 is a great replacement.  Photo quality & color, camera speed, you name it.  I have been shooting macro, landscape, and portrait with my new D7100 (using all my old lenses from the D70s) and have not been disappointed.  If you have been hemming and hawing about upgrading an aging consumer or prosumer Nikon camera, now is a great time to do so!I am currently using two Transcend 32GB class 10 memory cards and have not noticed any slowness shooting photos (RAW+JPEG) or 1080 video.Pros:- I am coming from a D70s, so I like most everything about this camera.- All the extra options.  I like options.  The D7100 is an improved version of my old camera, plus video, plus wifi (optional add-on), plus dual memory cards, etc etc.Cons:- The only con I have come up with so far is sound of the lens auto-focusing during video recordings.  It's definitely noticeable on the playback!  I have not tried the microphone accessory yet though. Overall, This camera is the best among its compatitors.
