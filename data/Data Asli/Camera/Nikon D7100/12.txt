i got this camera about a month ago from amazon.  photography has become a main hobby of mine that started about 10 years ago.  i have been through at least 8 cameras in these years, with the last 4 being dslr's.  i absolutely love this camera.  it has excellent low light capabilities and very fast.  i have 5 nikkor lenses,(2 prime), and a tokina lens.  this camera takes absolutely gorgeous pictures.  the BEST cropped sensor dslr money can buy!  $1200 for just the body may seem too much, but it is worth every penny.  get yourself some good glass(lens), and get pictures at pretty much the way your eye sees it in real life.  you'll feel like a pro just holding it.  the video on this camera is bar none, the best on any dslr i came across.  HD at it is finest.  arm yourself with two 32G extreme sd cards and let the fun begin.  Aloha.
