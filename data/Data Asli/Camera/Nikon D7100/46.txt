D7100 is a great DX body. Very responsive and quick in almost everything. AF, shutter, ON/OFF, body shortcuts, etc. Great IQ and resolution.One big problem: the buffer capacity. If you want to use RAW, mainly 14-bit, your shutter burst is very limited - 5 to 6. In JPG, it is OK.The image seems a little grainy also, in spite of many reviews showing a nice high ISO performance. But I think this may be well managed.Nice camera!
