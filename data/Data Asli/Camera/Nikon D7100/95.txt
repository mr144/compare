I think Nikon nailed it with this DSLR. I got this camera with the 85mm F/1.8 lens and extremely impressed by the quality of the images (sharpness, color). I compared it with the D600 (Which is a Full Frame) and the quality difference is minimal atleast to me; plus not worth more than 1G!I would recommend this to all semi-pro users!
