I have had this for a few days now and been pleasantly surprised at how well this does. I equate it to either the D300 or D300s for its abilities, although it does feel smaller/lighter.Pros relative to the D600 are its faster AF (not by much, but worthwhile) and the longer reach and greater DOF apparent, when shooting wide.Pros relative to the D7000 are its faster/more accurate AF, and the gentler sound of the shutter (I do prefer a quiet shutter). Other things of note are that the ISO is about a half stop better in most cases, but the bigger thing I see is the cleaner blue skies at lower ISO's. The addition of better weather sealing is not lost on me either. I have wanted a DX body with that for some time. Last notable thing that I appreciate is the locking buttons for the mode dials.Great cam for me.
