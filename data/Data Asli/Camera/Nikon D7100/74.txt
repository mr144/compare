The features on this camera are so many I have just explore a very small section.  But what I was looking for on the camera, I have obtained.  I am able to capture the ball &#34;frozen&#34; as well as the player taking the pictures indoors with bad lighting.I went with the 18-105mm lense because I did not want the added weight and assume I could bring the pictures closer digitally since the images are large enough.  However, now I wish I had purchased the 18-300 to be able to bring the subject closer while shooting Lax.Specially like the fast shooting and the control added as to how many will be snapped consecutively with the same focus...  I also liked that the settings dial is &#34;locked&#34; so it can only be change when you intent to change it.
