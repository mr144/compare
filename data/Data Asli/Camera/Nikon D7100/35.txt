I have the D5100, and used for over a year, it has taken great pictures.  During that time frame it had the same problem twice and both times I had to ship out for repair.  It was hard to function with a camera, so I purchase a second camera the D7100.  I purchase the body only because I already had several lens and they all worked great with the D7100.  I find myself using it for 90 precent of the pictures I have take today.  I still have a lot to learn about this camera, I fill I am still a beginner in photography, but with the D7100 I fill I can achive the next level sooner that later.  The D7100 is very quit, on my first use of the camera I thought it was broken, but when I looked to see if any pictures had been taken and everyone taken was there.  Although the camera is a little heavy, I like the fill of it.
