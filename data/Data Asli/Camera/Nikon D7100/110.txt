Update: Replacement works fine. Received my copy yesterday, booted the camera in Full Auto mode (default), mounted a new lens...camera would not autofocus.Tried all controls, rebooted, reset, different lens...nothing, even the focus light would not come on.Pressing the focus selector button and rotating the dials has no effect, it just would not budge focus servo mode or the focus area. Focus was set to manual by default (out of the box) otherwise I would have never noticed that this functionality is broken.Shipping back to Amazon today, requested replacement. Hoping it was just bad luck.
