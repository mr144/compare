After reading the reviews here, I decided to take the plunge and upgrade to the D7100.  I am certainly glad I did.  As many have previously commented, the pictures are tack sharp.  The color renditions are very accurate, also.  I would say to anyone still considering this camera just buy it.  You will not regret it at all.  Just be sure you take the time to setup the camera the way you prefer it before you rush out and start taking pictures.  I upgraded from the D7000, which is a great camera in its own right.  This one blows it away in all aspects from low light shots to portraits or landscapes and everything in between.  It is a little bit lighter than the D7000 and it feels great in my hands.  I have not used the video yet so I can not comment on that part.  The 1.3x crop is more useful than I expected.  It is wonderful for sports shots for the extra length it provides on your lenses.  That means my 18-200mm lens is about equal to 390mm when zooming in.  Again, the pictures in this mode are very good and this is where you can get 7 shots in burst mode.  I noticed no lag time in the shots I took testing this feature, although I did only take about 40 shots while testing it out.  Again, all I can say is 'WoW!'
