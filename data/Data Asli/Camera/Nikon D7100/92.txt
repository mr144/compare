This weekend I hope to put the D7100 to the test. (Weather permitting).  So far out of the box indoor shots have been great!  Focus is spot on, I can tell you will probably use my speedflash more than the on camera flash.  Maybe it is just me but man is the on camera flash bright!  I love the locking mode dial, my D7000 was always moving.  I love the weight of this camera.  So far works with my 50mm 1.4mm beautifully!  I will post pics once I can get outdoors and take pictures of nature!  I will give a more through update after this weekend!  So far I LOVE THIS CAMERA.  (Have owned D5000 and D7000).C
