I received a bad copy with serious auto focus. This camera does not focus at all and releases the shutter. Requested the new copy from Amazon.Update:I received a new copy from Amazon. It has the same auto focus issue. I created a service ticket with Nikon and they could not solve the problem. Returning the second one and waiting for new replacement from Amazon.
