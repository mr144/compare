i received the D7100 less than a week ago and everything is perfect. A great upgrade to a D3X00 or D5X00. sharp as a needle. quick aufo focus and overall amazing. i cannot even put down in words how great of a camera this is.  absolutely suberb performance. its lightweight, sturdy, has the latest innovations in technology. i would recommend to anyone and everyone wanting a more professional DX body nikon. bottom line. nikon has outdone themselves.
