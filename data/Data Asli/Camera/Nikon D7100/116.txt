I posted an earlier review where I complained about being unable to process RAW files in Aperture but should have known that Apple would have to update Aperture to make it possible !My other complaint was that my new Nikon D7100 was changing image quality (e.g. from JPEG to RAW and back again) for no apparent reason. Thanks to input from other owners and Nikon Support I now know that this was my fault not the camera's ! When changing Iso I was sometimes also pressing the quality (+) button so that turning the command dial changed the image quality.I upgraded to the D7100 from the D7000 and they are both superb cameras.
