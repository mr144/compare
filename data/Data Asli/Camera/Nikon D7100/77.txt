I have had my D7100 now for 4 days. Its everything I expected from reading the reviews and detailed descriptions before I purchased it. Initial shots are crisp and clear and the performance of the 18-105mm zoom lens is excellent from what I have seen so far. I am upgrading to a more capable camera from my old D60 that I thoroughly enjoyed using and will keep as an emergency backup, but If I do not ever need it. My D7100 is now my go-to. Functionally this camera has just about all the high-end features I wanted, depth-of-field preview, auto bracketing, and very flexible programming options. Besides having excellent resolution and color rendition, it offers as much or as little control as you desire. I can see a big difference in performance from my D60, and I have only just begun to explore all of the control options. With the 24 MP resolution, I am glad I did not waste  the extra money going to an FX format model. Also I am glad to be able to use my beautiful NIKKOR Ai  manual-focus non-CPU lenses that have spent the last several years in my camera bag. The ability to program them into the camera's computer and full meter coupling for these classics makes them as useable as they ever were. I also like the lightning fast processing rate and very quite operation of the D7100 even in regular Single or Continuous modes.
