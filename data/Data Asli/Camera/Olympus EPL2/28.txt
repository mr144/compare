Bought this camera a month ago to capture better quality pictures of the baby and everything that comes with it, and something not too bulky to carry around.  The builtin pop up flash that can be tilted and the shape of the body were main reasons I chose this over the EPL3.  Although the kit lens I hear is slower than the EPL3, but at least it is faster that the EPL1.some cons: in dim/dark situations, with the kit lens, it does have a slow focus, and you can tell it is searching for the right focus.  I like to set the focus to Single  but allow Manual Adjustment, then I still have control to tweak the initial focus. the video record button placement, i wish were closer in from the edge or on the top as it sometimes can be accidentally pressed, especially for selfportraits.pros: picture quality is much better than my Panasonic ZS7 point and shoot, it just seems more dynamic, less flat. the auto setting for the flash seems to do pretty good on it is own.  Adding the ability to tilt the flash helps when flash is needed.  It would have been nice if the flash would have been able to stay tilted, but it springs naturally back to forward.  I found zooming the lens to 25mm with the tilt flash looks the best as then you do not see as much of the lighting contrast. the kit lens is collapsible.  I know some do not like that you have to unlock the lens to use it, but i like that it can collapse to a smaller size to carry around.
