I gotta be honest, I am not a professional photographer, or even come close to calling myself an amateur photographer. I wanted something light, not a point_and_shoot, but something that can get me excited about shooting outdoors. I felt like this was the camera worth investing, in that it is performance was pretty uptodate, looked beautiful, and had reputation of great quality. The ability to change lens sold me completely, and it is the perfect hybrid of the two worlds. The lens is great for starting out, and I am slowly going to be saving for a fancier lens later on.This is my first amazon review ever.....and well worth writing one for this product! I have been getting nonstop compliments and question about this camera. Really happy with the price that it came in...and also oredered a white carrying bag from ebay. Lovely match!
