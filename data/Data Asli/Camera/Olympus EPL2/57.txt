I have used the Oly Pen EPL2 for about six months now and I can say it is a pretty nice camera. I am a photo enthusiast, and I usually shoot with my Leica M8.2 or Canon 7D.  I just needed a portable camera that was budget friendly that other people could use if I wanted a photo of me.  The SLR is too big, and the Leica is too expensive not to mention it is not user friendly to strangers.  The Olympus is not pocketable, however it is okay...I just put it in my purse or carry bag.  The camera is customizable so you can set it up for your preferences (nice). But right out of the box, I found I could use the iAuto and let the camera think for me, and I immediately produced beautiful photos effortlessly. Anyone can use this camera on iAuto and the results out of the camera will be very good and ready to use. Some noise was visible in the shadow areas of my living if blown up larger, but a noise reduction program would easily take that out.I use Elements or Aperture to process my photos, so no review about the included software. I never use the camera's included software.I love the white and silver.  It looks like a normal point and shoot, so folks do not mind me taking pictures in public.Overall great camera!
