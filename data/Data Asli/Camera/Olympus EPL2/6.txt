I have had this camera for a couple of months now. It has taken some time to learn the best settings for the right shooting situations. There is an option to have user controlled settings preset into the different shooting modes. I found that to be very useful. The iAuto does an okay job in bright light and still shots, but you really need to learn the settings to optimize photos for action and lowlight. The camera is fast, looks nice (a bit retro in the front), and has a large, high resolution screen that is easy to see in all but the brightest sun.Tip: read the details of the user guide and also some internet research for optimizing the settings, it makes a huge difference in photo quality.
