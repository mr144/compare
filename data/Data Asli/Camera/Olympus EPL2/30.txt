I have had this camera for a week and I am extremenly pleased with it and I would not hesitate to recommend it!  I had an SLR camera many years ago with several lenses and enjoyed it, but found the bulk, difficulty of use, etc to be a problem.  Once the era of small digital cameras came in, I switched and have had a succession of digitals ever since including Panasonic, Canon, Samsung, etc.  I have been happy with the results and especially the portability but I have recently wanted to get into better quality photos, more flexibilty, etc.  After doing a lot of research and finding the Olympus EPL2 at a really great price (under $400)with the 1442mm lens, I decided to take the plunge.  I am really glad I did!  Picture quality is a substantial upgrade, the ergonomics of the camera are terrific and I was taking pictures minutes after I charged the battery the day it arrived!  The camera has exceeded my expectations in all areas.  Do not be put off by the menu options, etc  just spend some time experimenting and taking shots and very soon you will be comfortable with this camera.  It's very intuitive, once you understand the design and setup.  I am just an average amateur with a pretty good eye and a desire to get back into the hobby in a bigger way and this camera is the tool to do that!  The Scene Functions offer a lot of options and the Art functions are a lot of fun, easy to use and offer some creative touches.  Overall, I think Olympus has done a great job in design, functionality, price and flexibity!  I am looking forward to purchasing a telephoto lens and probably the pancake lens to complete the package. If you are considering moving up from a small digital  run, do not walk, to buy this camera.
