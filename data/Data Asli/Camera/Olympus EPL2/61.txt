Resuming... a good purchase!Again Olympus get me feeling I paid a fair price and get bit more value for the price. I have used many compacts, and recently a have owned a D5000 from Nikon, what has been stolen. The general picture is very good, and in some cases superior to D5000 from my point of view, specially in sharpness and color saturation. Controls are somewhat easy, but near to a compact than a DSLR, but very usable and powerful. This camera is overall very recommendable.
