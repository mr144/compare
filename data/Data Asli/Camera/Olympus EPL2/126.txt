I recently sold my Nikon D70, which I have had for years, and bought this camera. I must say I am glad I did. The camera is small and light weight. I find myself taking this camera places i would have left my old Nikon behind. This alone makes the camera worth while to have. If you do not have the camera with you then you cannot get a picture. The focus is fast and the shutter lag time is nonexistent. I really like the live scenes and artistic modes of the camera. I have the standard lens and the Telephoto lens and they both work great. The video is HD and it works well for short videos. I did find that the lens would need to focus during the video especially if you zoom in or out. This gives a brief time that the video is out of focus. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a SLR but would like to not carry around a large heavy camera.
