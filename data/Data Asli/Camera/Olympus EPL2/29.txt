I have used this camera for about 8 months. I upgraded to it from canon digicams as I yearned for better photos. It has the right mix of professional level controls and novice controls like iAuto that will adjust features like background blur, depth of background focus etc to create excellent pictures.Kit lens is average but has the advantage of cheap accessories like wide angle adapter which has helped with indoor family shots where distances may be limited. It's highly portable even pocketable in cargo pants and was an excellent travel companion on a trip to London. I packed this camera, the kit lens, panasonic pancake 20/1.7 lens and a tablet in a slim laptop bag and was able to hop in and out of buses and the underground without being burdened with the weight of dslr.Combined with the above mentioned panasonic lens it takes excellent pictures as it allows a lower ISO setting. I find the flash very useful and even has a limited bounce feature. In addition the flash has multiple settings unlike a digicam. Another advantage is the wide selection of reasonably priced lenses especially primes, plus using a cheap adapter Olympus' 4/3 lens are also available. I have had very good experience with the 40/150 3.5 telephoto lens. In body stabilisation also allows use of a wide variety of new and older lens with varying adapters. It may be expensive compared to an entry level dslr but in my opinion the size and comparative image quality more than compensates for this. Autofocus is slower than in the 3 series pens but not one of those cameras has the complete feature set of the EPL2. Therefore I will keep this camera and wait for a cheaper member of the new OMD series to be released.
