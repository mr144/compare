I purchased this back in summer 2011 and it is been nothing but good to me. I got the white body because I suppose I am a hipster like that (or whatever the kids are calling it). In the two years it is certainly taken a beating but it is kind of like the Energizer bunny as it just keeps going and going. The finish has a few nicks and scratches at this point but the camera is aging well. I still use it frequently but it is taken a backseat regarding use as I now use Nikon SLRs for most of my photography. Now I mostly use this as a sort of party camera where I set it to jpg only in aperture priority and autoISO and use the grainy b&w filter. It's quite fantastic in that capacity. The kit lens never got a lot of use so I can not really comment on it but it still looks good. Overall I am very pleased but at this point you should probably get something newer.
