I bought an Olympus PEN EPL2 w/ kit lens and with a Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 lens separately last week and since then cannot let go of it. I take it everywhere I go, and I shoot everything, anything that moves and does not move, day and night, outdoor and indoor. The photos blow my mind away. Upon seeing photos, people are keen to ask what camera I use.* Portability *This camera is incredibly small, about half the size of an entrylevel DSLR. It's about the size of a bridge camera except EPL2 is thinner. It could not be slipped into a pocket, but it is so portable that I have no trouble taking it everywhere I go.* Low Profile *EPL2 having such a classic lowprofile design is a perfect quality camera for candid photography of kids and people who get intimidated by prolooking DSLR. I do not know but people tend to get too serious when faced with professional camera gears. The purpose of candid photography is not really to spy on them but to capture them in their most natural poses with genuine smiles. The retrolooking compact design seems to avert their attention away. People do not seem to mind having photos taken as much. When I am out on the streets, this camera does not scream for attention. People will not stare at you. They will not come asking.* Image Quality *I find noises very acceptable up to ISO 1600. At ISO 3200, the noises get very noticeable although quite acceptable for general use in a family album, blog or Facebook. At its highest ISO, 6400, the image quality gets degraded so much you would have to be desperate to use it.EPL2 reigns supreme in blurring out the background, isolating the subjects. Ideal photos that look awesome define where the eyes should look at, by giving tack sharp focus on where it matters the most. This would be incredibly difficult to achieve with a typical compact, as everything is always in focus. Not that you can not shoot great photos with a P&S compact, but EPL2 opens up a new dimension to photographers, a dimension that allows the viewers to visualize depth in 2D photos.* Night and Indoor Photography *EPL2 performs wonderfully in low light. I find I am able to shoot away at ISO 1600 at night and at ISO 800 indoor with a few bright lights. The photos are very acceptable.The noise sensitivity is almost on par with an entrylevel DSLR (such as Canon Rebel T3i or Nikon D5000). EPL2 has a 4/3 sensor with an area of 200mm� when cropped to 3:2 aspect ratio. That is about 55% of 370mm� area of an APSC sensor inside a modern crop DSLR, and in comparison, EPL2 sensor gets only about half the amount of light at the same shutter speeds. To make up for the loss of light, Olympus makes a design change. Firstly, the pixel density of EPL2 in 3:2 aspect ratio is reduced to 10MP from 1518MP of a typical DSLR. Lowering the pixel density gives space to making larger photodiodes on the sensor which allows more light collection per pixel. The reduction of the megapixels keep signal amplification power only marginally higher, and that will lead to only a slight increase of grainy noises in the photos.EPL2 sensor may be smaller than that of a DSLR's APSC sensor, but it is still five to nine times the size of  sensors found in typical compacts. As the larger EPL2 sensor gathers much more light, EPL2 will have considerably less noises. It matters a lot whenever it goes dark.* Builtin Flash *The builtin flash is conceptually new in a way that you pop it up and can hold it upright to bounce the flash off the ceiling, and it works pretty good too, granted that the ceiling is not too high. You should however expect to get an external flashgun for the job if you are serious in getting plenty of light on the subjects.For night portraits, I usually underexpose the flash by two stops (by setting the FEC to 2). By underexposing the flash, the camera will use the available ambient light as the primary/key light, and a bit of flash will fill in the shadows and lighten up the faces, giving a more natural look.* Sensorshift Image Stabilization *For handheld shots, EPL2 sensor could shift to stabalize the shots by about two stops, even if the lens does not have IS.A few things you should note though. The sensorshift IS works only for still photos and only during the exposure. It is not activated when you press the shutter button halfway and when in movie mode (which is the standard behavior of lensbased IS).It is pretty loud but also such a beauty to observe a shifting sensor while shooting lensless.* Focus *It's a mirrorless that relies on contrast detection to focus on subjects, unlike DSLRs which have dedicated AF phasedetection sensors to do the job. While contrastdetection AF is generally slower and less acurate than the phasedetection AF, I find that EPL2 focuses blazingly fast and accurate. In low light, the AF hits and misses (which is also an issue for phasedetection AF).* Conclusion *If you own a DSLR, you will find EPL2 a great complement for fun and professional uses. It takes awesome photos in shallow depth of field and in low light. The real loss over a DSLR is the loss of pixel density but EPL2's 10MP is good enough for large prints.UPDATE: 05/29/2011* Cons *After using for another month, some limitations are getting more apparent. Firstly, a video clip is limited to 2GB in size. Since EPL2 records videos in the outdated MotionJPEG format that consumes much higher bandwidth than the newer AVCHD/MP4, a clip can last only for 7 mins 30 secs. It however does not stop you from recording more clips till the card is filled up. Secondly, while ISO can be changed in the video mode, only ISO 400 to 1600 are selectable. I have no idea why the ISO 200 is not.* Issue *The issues apply particularly to this unit I bought. It might say something about the build quality.Apparently, after two months of use, the builtin flash went dead. It's probably a mintor electrical contact problem since it pops up and down like that. External flashgun still works with it though.
