Panasonic GF2 and epl2 where the 2 cameras that I was looking for. I found that both of them were remarkably similar but chose EPL2 because it had a better low light performance, and true to its word I was astounded by the ISO 1600 pic qualities. The low lights pictures are beautiful, they do show a little noise in the dark regions. The automode is absolutely fabulous and you can take very nice pictures, but using the same settings, as the automode, in the manual mode it is impossible to produce that same image colors or white balance. I find this puzzling and I think this has to do with some processing of the jpegs in the automode absent in the manual mode. I have used this camera with canon eos 1.8/50mm lens and a 1978 vivitar f/3.5 200mm lens. The pics are fabulous, however you only get metering in the manual mode and even then these are off by a stop number. The kit lens 14mm45mm has okay quality and you get decent pictures.Overall if you just want to use this as a point and shoot camera, use the automode you will be surprised by the quality. To use this in the manual mode with different lenses you do need to struggle around a bit, and post process the pictures to get the desired quality picture.
