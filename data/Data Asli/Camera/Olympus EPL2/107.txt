First off let me say this is still a okay camera, Its handling is nice, however as someone who had a Sony Nex 3 beforehand; there are some major points of contention that have to be said that the brand sheep here are oblivious to.1)Crop Factor. Ultra wide angle? Forget about it, its not happening with this tiny 2x crop sensor and is massively more constricting than the 1.5x crop factor APSC cameras.2)low light ISO performance. Likely for the same reason as above; the low light performance and resolution suffer badly from the small sensor. The sensor is worse than Nikon D7100. Strongly improved over the EPL1 its still lacking next to the now old Sony Nex cameras.3)Price! Micro 4/3rd cameras would definitely have a niche for around $400 and would revolutionize smaller sensor compact cameras. As it is; it is squarely in Samsung, Sony Nikon and Canon entry enthusiast territory, all with bigger better sensors.4)Size, it is not so small. With the 16mm pancake lens my old Nex was a true pocket camera, not nearly so much as with the Olympus and its atrociously narrow frame pancake lens.Still I will be keeping this camera till I find another 1.5x sensor camera. The hot shoe and design of the camera is nice, but honestly I hate Olympus for making this camera half frame just for higher profits and to 'honor' the old PEN cameras. What a fool I was to run from a superior camera just because of a wonky menu system.
