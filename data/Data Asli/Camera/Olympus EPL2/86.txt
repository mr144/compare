This camera is the perfect travel companion and great for street photography. It does not draw too much attention due to its size, styling and small lenses. The inbody image stabilization is fantastic as is the built in flash.  The flash is designed in a way that allows it to be bounced off the ceiling, allowing for a more natural look. The wireless flash support was a key seller for me...I do not have an olympus flash unit but plan on picking up the FL36R for travel.  I have this camera with the kit 1442 and a panasonic 20mm f/1.7.  The 1442 is silent and is sharp, but the lens construction is on the cheap side and it is slow (in fstop, not autofocus).  Autofocus is fantastic with both lenses and comparable to a GF1 in focusing speed.  I love the image quality and the high iso performance is pretty good; images are usable at ISO 1600.  The noise that is present has a filmlike quality....Overall, this is a fantastic kit at a great price....its not going to replace my 7D for shooting motorsports or wildlife but it definitely does well in all other scenarios.
