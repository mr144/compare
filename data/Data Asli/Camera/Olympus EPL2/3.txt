Yes their are beter cameras, but this works well for me. A work horse for timelapse as raw files not so big but can get sharp images from unit. Guess I am use to using this camera and holding out for the next wave of mirrorless to step up. But these are great for fun and cheap $$$, good quality images and unit/glass.
