Phenomenal camera for its size. Really, really good image quality in both JPEG and RAW, especially in ample lighting. The ability to use legacy lenses really helps in creativity and versatility.  The size means you can carry it to more places (hiking, parties, urban photography, travel, etc). Studio photos are very competitive with larger DSLRs, as well.  Very versatile and a great foundation for anyone looking to get into more manual control or as an excellent alternative to larger dSLR.I use this camera with the 1442mm MKII kit lens, a Konica Hexanon 40mm f1.8 legacy lens, a Konica Hexanon 50mm f1.7 legacy lens, the Olympus VF2 viewfinder, and a Metz 44AF strobe.  A great buy overall!!
