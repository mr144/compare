As a newbie to photography, the EPL2 really appealed to me. I felt it was time to move beyond my old Canon Powershot 880 IS to something with some more manual control. So far I am not disappointed. This could be a great stepping stone for anyone who wants to move up to SLRs but are not quite ready just yet.
