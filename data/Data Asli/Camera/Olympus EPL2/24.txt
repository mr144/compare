I wanted something more than a point and shoot camera but not a DSLR (I never had the knack to learn the nittygritties of photography and I did not want to carry around a big camera). Hence went for a Olympus PEN EPL2. This works like a charm. I mostly use the Automode or one of the Scene options. The picture quality is amazing. I am quite happy with the results. Though I believe the pictures in low light could be a bit better in Automode. I would definitely recommend this camera to others.
