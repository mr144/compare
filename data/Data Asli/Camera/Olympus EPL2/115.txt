I was shopping around a decent micro 4/3 camera. Read a lot of reviews and even tried several of the new arrivals. Having used an E PL1 in the past I knew about the quality of Olympus M43s cameras. Although the white version looks a bit flimsy and plasticky at times, it feels about right in your hands and image quality is really good. Love the art filters that it has loaded up. The new Mark 2 lens it comes with is really silent and useful for most of the jobs you throw it. JPEG engine is superb, as in other Olympuses. For the good image quality and discounted price, is hard to be wrong with this Olympus.
