I am very impressed with the quality of the photos and the responsiveness of the camera.  I have owned the Olympus e510 and currently own the e620.  I love the compactness and the low light(with no flash) photo quality in comparison with the large DSLR Olympus Cameras.  I am probably going to sell my e620 now that I see the quality of the photos and the compactness of the camera.  The only downside is the lack of viewfinder but I can get beyond that for now.  Some day I may buy the optional electric viewfinder.  The camera is very well made and easy to use, though I was already familiar with Olympus. Videos are great also with this camera.  For $300 it is a very good buy.
