I used my camera to take pictures at meetings. It had a boring life, and a remarkably short one, too. When a plastic ring in the lens got dislodged, making it impossible to extend, I sent it to Olympus for a repair. They found &#34;evidence of extensive impact damage&#34; and said it was not economically practical to repair the item. I had owned the camera much less than a year. But they offered 20% off a new Olympus lens. No, thank you very much. If I am going to get ripped off again, I'll give a different company a crack at me. But never another Olympus ever again. I am so disappointed in this company.
