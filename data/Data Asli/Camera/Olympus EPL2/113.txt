I wanted to upgrade from my Panasonic DMCFZ50 (a very good camera with a Leica designed lens). I did a lot of research. My criteria: higher quality pictures, which meant a larger processor, portability (if possible lighter than the Panasonic as most of my photography is on vacations and I did not want to lug around heavy equipment) and a good viewfinder (which meant ruling out cameras which only have LCD screens like the NEX5  in daylight I find LCDs useless for serious photography). Some DSLRs are reasonably compact, like the Sony A55 or the small Pentax, but remember telephoto lenses are still big and heavy. So the field narrowed to micro four thirds cameras which have processors close to DLSRs in size but still remain easily portable although not pocketable. I ruled out the GH2 as too expensive and the G2 and others as still too large. I settled on the Pen EPL2 and have not been disappointed. Straight out of the box on automatic settings it takes great pictures. A nottoocritical family member recognized the improved picture quality right away.Purchasing the optional electronic viewfinder is a MUST (at $275 it is not cheap) but is really excellent. The LCD is no good outdoors. I am happy to forego the DSLR mirror view. The LCD cannot be tilted but the EVF can be rotated to 90 degrees to make it easire to take low down flower pictures.It usually takes me at least a year to get completely familiar with a new camera and I expect the EPL2 will be the same, especially as the menu options are complicated and the manual is difficult to parse. I am waiting for 'EPL2 for Dummies' to be published. Meanwhile I will enjoy the great pictures using mainly automatic settings but will dock my rating a star for excessively complicated menus and a poor manual. By the way,I bought the 40150 lens as well as the 1442 kit lens in a package offered by Amazon. It weighs only 8 ounces and is probably the only lens you will need most of the time.
