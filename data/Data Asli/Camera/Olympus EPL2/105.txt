This is my first dslr camera and it is been great so far.  Coming from a point and shoot world, I wanted something I could keep close without a huge bag but that could take better pictures.So far, I have mostly been using point and shoot mode.  And the image quality is orders of magnitude better than my old camera.  Add in the shutter speed that actually takes a picture when you push the button instead of having a delay...and I could not go back.I have only brushed the surface of all I can do with this camera.  But their are a ton of settingseverything I need to start off in the world of dslr.
