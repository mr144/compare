I have been interested in a mirroless camera since they were introduced,but since I already own a Dslr camera I question the price of these smaller camera with a smaller sensor. Now that the prices are dropping on some of the slightly older models; I felt like I could justify the cost of owning another camera. I compared several brands and finally settled on the Olympus Pen EPL2. Wow!! I love it. This camera is light and easy to carry when I do not want to lug around my larger camera. The menus are easy to use, takes excellent pictures and handles very well. I have purchased an electronic viewfinder and a longer zoom lens and I am very pleased. I do not have any negatives and would highly recommend to anyone with a little photo knowlege and enjoys taking good photographs.
