The EPL2 is one of the most enjoyable cameras I have used along with the Lumix 20mm f/1.7 lens attached. This Pen Lite (my first Olympus) deserves five stars if you try to view photography as an art form, not just technical specifications. I am not a pro so it is hard to do with so much emphasis on specs. You get a different feel from the PEN in comparison to the similar Panasonic m4/3 cameras. Each has it own merits. I think the EPL2 remains true to the spirit of the GF1 more than the new GF series. I never owned a Leica, but now understand why people love them.The EPL2 has it quirks and will not be for everyone. I am use to shooting Canon and Panasonic. At first I was put off by the AF, menu and white balance under indoor lighting, but once I got the menu and buttons down, I could make the proper adjustments easily. Some reviews complain about no dedicated WB button, but this not a problem if you learn the camera.The jpeg results have very pleasing colors that seem warm and natural. I would say the shots have more pleasing skin tones than my technically better Lumix G3. (I reviewed the G3 also on Amazon.) Noise is controlled well up to 1600 ISO and is it does not exhibit chroma blotches that even DSLRs produce. The art filters are fun to play with on the camera.There is a new model, the EPL3, but I prefer the retro styling (grip) and builtin flash of the EPL2. The price seems to have come down on this model at Amazon. There are new 12mm and 45mm m4/3 lenses coming out, but for now the 20mm is the best value.
