I have owned an EPL2 for over a year now, and I have taken thousands of pics with it.  First of all, the kit 1442 lens is great.  Very sharp and easy to use.  The camera's scene and art modes take some time to appreciate, but are well worth it once you understand how to apply them.  My 4 star rating would be 5 stars because the camera does take some trial and error to use properly.  If someone is used to a Nikon DSLR with it is simple operating controls and functions, then the EPL2 is going to frustrate them.  It's not a big clunky Nikon that everyone sees the pros using at weddings.  No.  It's a small(ish) and tech geeky sort of critter, and very fun to take with you whereever you may be going, instead of dragging the big monster Nikon with you.  And the pics do turn out great in available light.  The flash is also built in, and easy to use for fill in when needed.  I used the 45150 lens for taking available light pics from the back of a large hall and I was then convinced at just how great a lens that is as well.  Get the 45150 lens and you will not be sorry, that's for sure.  I am adding a final point that I am now in process of selling off my EPL2 in order to purchase an EPL5 camera.  I will use the same lenses, but I really wanted the moveable rear viewing screen, not to mention that the EPL5 is a step ahead in having a larger chip.  But this is not to say that the EPL2 is a slouch in any sense of the word, and they are pretty cheap now (under $300 new with the kit lens).  So get one if you are considering a Micro4/3 camera.  The Sony is too darn expensive and I do not like their color balance (yes, it can be adjusted, but why does the factory setting have to be wrong?)  Sorry sony fans, but the NX cameras are not as good as Olympus.  Sadly, now that Sony owns Olympus, I expect for them to make changes to the product line and possibly not for the best.  That's my mini antisony rant for now.  Olympus good, sony just OK.
