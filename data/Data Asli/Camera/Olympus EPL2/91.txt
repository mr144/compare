Jumped on a sale of this camera and the newer 1442mm, and I love it. Light, but sturdy. Very good picture quality, easy to use. Make sure to update the firmware (not hard to do) because it'll give your autofocusing a healthy improvement.Best thing for me is the compactness. Combine this camera with this lens, a 45200mm and a VF3 viewfinder, and it still takes up only a little more space than one of my Canon 50Ds with a 1755 lens.The popup flash is rather interesting because, if you simply pull the mechanism back slightly, you can bounce the flash off the ceiling for a better looking portrait(make sure you are at least 34 feet from your subject, but not more than about 12 feet)I was not thrilled with the white color, especially when you add the silver VF3 and the black 45200mm, but it does have the advantage of not getting really hot in the sun.
