samples[...]remove the starsLet me start by saying that I would not trade my P2 for any Panasonic micro 4/3 camera including the new GH2 (which I tried, hopping for a better all around camera than my P2. It failed miserably in the stills area).Pluses:1. Good grip2. Nice finish, close to GF1 quality. Not bad, not great.3. The flash4. The back wheel, though I have the P2 with two wheels. It might be a really improvement for people coming for PL15. IBIS6. Nice LCDMinuses:1. Autofocus speed. I got fooled by all reviews saying that EPL2 has a faster AF than the previous pens. I have had it for 4 days now and for the life of me I cannot make a difference in AF between pl2 and p2. Maybe the fact that the lens is silent gives the feeling that is faster but, honestly, I cannot see it.2. The kit lens. I still cannot believe Olympus builds this kind of garbage (and I am nice). The pictures look washed out, kinda cheap, flat, point and shoot look. This lens reminds me the kit lens sold with all Canons back in the day. Pure garbage.3. ISO base for stills 200? Yes, I knew before I bought it but I only realized how mandatory is ISO 100 when I started using the PL2.4. ISO base for video 400? This must be an Olympus joke. Even ISO 200 on a P2 is a stretch, but 400? One needs a ton of ND's to get the speed down to 1/30 outside.5. Noise at base ISO. The level of noise in dark areas at base iso is unreal. Blotches and spots. Horrible. And it is not the kit lens, I tried both cameras (p2 and pl2) with the Panasonic 20mm. Before jumping up and down people should try shooting objects inside that have dark surfaces, like furniture.If I did rate the Olympus P2 4 stars, I could not rate the PL2 more than 2 stars. Maybe 3 if it comes down around $300, though the lower price does not make it a better camera, it is only the feeling that I did not spend that much for a mediocre device.Again, you can call me anytime an Olympus fanboy, and I would not mind, but the PL2 is not a keeper. Take care!
