I love this camera.  It's replaced my Olympus E3.  The Micro 4/3rds system has replaced my 4/3rds.  I have replaced my lenses because of this camera.  Works with my wireless FL50 flashes.Downsizing is wonderful for the mind & back, no more lugging around heavy lenses & bodies.  Not so wonderful for the wallet but that comes with the territory!Cons?  Needs full HD video
