i have the old epl1 and this is THE UPGRADE, firs the quality build is awesome is more robust construction, lot of corrected details like the metal triangles for the strap now comes with plastic cover because in the old pen this little guys scratch the cam, the lense kite is improve smaller, quicker, and light, the grip of the cam is also improve is not cheap plastic, more like leather grip or something idk, compare with the epl1 this one is more biggy more thick but still very portable, when it power ups the difference is very notable, Live view is improved faster and the big higher res screen wins. the popup flash is more powerful and the control wheel is great. Is an awesome camera.
