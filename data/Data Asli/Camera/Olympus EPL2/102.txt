i bought both cameras and returned one. i could have gone either way. the epl1 has the best image quality available in a four hundred dollar camera, period. i ended up keeping the pl2 mainly because i wanted the better kit lens which also supports wide angle converter lenses. i am interested in wide angle photography and this was cheaper for me in the long run (over either buying the epl1 + mkII kit lens or epl1 + one of the extremely expensive wide angle lenses). the EPL2's better screen, additional art filter (really useful, imo), and better manual controls made the decision even easier. it is also much more solidly built. on the other hand, i thought the pl1's screen was perfectly adequate and i still personally prefer the more retro styling of the epl1 and would probably recommend the epl1 to anyone who just wanted the absolute best bang/buck image quality. if you want to use converter lenses (on the kit lens) and the dramatic tone filter then i strongly recommend the EPL2.my previous cameras were all point_and_shoots, but i have also spent some time playing with a friend's canon dslr.
