I purchased this camera from amazon about a month ago in an effort to rekindle my photography hobby... it worked!  The picture quality rivals my film SLR cameras in the more common photo sizes.My main complaints about this camera kit is that one, the 1442mm lens is horrible in low light.  Not entirely unexpected with a kit zoom lens. I highly recommend picking up the Panasonic 20mm pancake for anything that requires a decent shutter speed in light comparable to a sunset or dimmer.My second complaint is that the neck strap included is a coarse woven nylon strap that feels like it wants to take my skin with it every time the camera shifts during basic walking.  If you plan on using this with a neck strap, look into a neoprene based strap.I chose the EPL2 over the EPL3 mainly because of body design.  The EPL3 is just a smooth block that does not offer much in the way of grip; It's just not comfortable to hold something like that for any extended period of time.Overall, the EPL2 is a pleasure to shoot with.  I find that I simply can not put it down.  If you are thinking about buying the Panasonic GF2 you should take that into consideration.  The GF2 is just boring, it feels too plain.
