Size: It is not that small, but not that big. It is not a pocket camera to carry with, yet it is kind of small in your hand for a good grip.Focus: It will get the focus, but slow for my taste.Lens: The kid lens tend to be too warm and mask a yellowish to the images. battery is good, it hold a charge for months in storage and last the whole day on a typical use.Video: I like it a lot. I would say, it does video better than still picture. This camera is better than canon, fujifilm, GE, Coolpix, Panasonic, pentax, kodak or sony.
