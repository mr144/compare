Although I have not used this camera for long, i really enjoyed the time I had with it. The screen is very nice and large but does not look very good in low light situations (which I think is common for LCDs). The autofocus is pretty snappy in most conditions but may become a problem in low light. I feel that if they included a autofocus assist lamp, this issue would have been solved. Pushing the ISO up until around 1600 should give you clean shots and the IBIS is a great thing to have especially with primes which normally do not have IS. Body feels very sturdy and not like cheap plastic which I thought it would have felt like by the pictures of the camera. Overall great camera, not the smallest micro43 camera but the grip is very nice and the design is very good.
