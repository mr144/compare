Finally a 4/3 camera with great skin tones and a high definition LCD.  With the 1.4 meg viewfinder, you have the complete package.  We took some pictures with this camera at CES and the results were great.  Much better than the EPL1 cause its screen allows you to evaluate if the picture is in focus, etc.  And the skin tones are from Olympus so they are great, unlike the Panasonic inferior skin tones and jpegs, the Oly engine is great for jpegs.  Pictures I took were hi ISO indoors with no flash and they came great.  Also the EPL2 is a handsome camera, whereas the EPL1 was not.  I liked the black model and the silver model the same.  The new kit lens is compact.  A real winner.  Works great with the Panasonic 20mm lens.
