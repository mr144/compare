I recently purchased the Olympus PEN EPL2 and am absolutely amazed at the quality of pictures.  Before purchasing this camera, I did a great deal of research.  And decided to go with the 4/3rd's micro option.  I am very glad I did this.  I am still learning all the features, but am in love with this camera.  I'll definitely be buying additional lenses.
