I spent a long time comparing the reviews between this camera and some of the other DSLRs that came out at the time. Some of the review sites lets you compare identical images side by side from different cameras at the same ISO level and it always felt like this one came out sharper than any of the big names.  Maybe it is because it is mirrorless, or the antishake mechanism is built into the sensor instead of the lens, or some internal sharpfilter algorithm.  That's all up for debate and I do not know, I just know what I see. And if having a sharp photo is not your thing just widen the aperture to max and you can still get a very shallow depth of field and a pleasantly blurry background if you are taking portraits.This was also my first large sensor camera and in comparison my old compact cameras with their 1/2.3' sensors just looked so grainy I got rid of them completely and just walk around with this in a small Case Logic carrying case about the size of my wife's Prada purse.Overall great camera and excellent low light performance, and if you are shooting in really low light just turn on the RAW+JPG format mode and make some minor adjustments in Adobe Lightroom. (Free trials are available if you have never used it.)  There's so much extra information stored in RAW it is like CSI magic.
