Let me start this by saying that I have owned digital cameras since 2000  2 Sonys, a Nikon, a Canon G9, the first Rebel, and a 20D.  I have photographed weddings, charity events, and have been paid for my work, so I know how to use a camera.  Never before I have owned a camera so frustrating to get a picture in focus.  I have read the manual for this camera and understand how the contrast detection autofocus works, but the infocus shots with the kit lens comprise no more than 4050% of the pictures and video taken so far, no matter what mode it used.  Other digicams I have owned have been slow to autofocus, but if they could not lock on, they told you so.  The EPL2 is a liar, promising that the AF has locked on, but more often than not it is focusing on the background.  The shallower depth of field from the larger sensor makes the problem worse.  Unfortunately, without any kind of viewfinder, I do not see any fix for this.While the camera feels very nice in the hand, be aware that cheap materials have been used to build the camera to a price point.  The rear LCD screen has a cover that is plastic, not glass, and it scratches if you so much as look at it too hard.  I have had 2 other cameras with a similar cover design  but they both used glass and survived years of use without a scratch.  It does not bode well for this camera's longterm durability.The positives of this camera come from that larger sensor  it has lowlight capabilities for still pictures and video that far exceed other digital cameras, and when the focus does work you can produce a nicely defocused background to highlight the subject.  It comes with betterthanaverage software to process RAW images, and there is a nice ecosystem of accessories and small, light lenses that take full advantage of the Micro 4/3 format.Perhaps my kit lens is defective since other reviews are so positive, I do not know.  Just make sure your retailer has a generous return policy.
