I have been using this for about a year now, and I continue to be astonished by the quality, clarity, and richness of the images. I have owned a number of highend point_and_shoot cameras because the compactness is very important to me. I like to have the camera with me all the time, everywhere I go, without having to think about it. The Olympus Pen EPL2 gives me that carrying convenience while delivering image quality dramatically better than the highend compact cameras.For maximum compactness, including ease of carrying in a small pocketbook, I purchased a pancake lens. With this I do not have zoom ability, but the camera is very very very small. In most situations because the image and resolution are so good I can crop down to get fairly good pictures of fairly distant things. If I think I'll be actively looking for longdistance shots, I just carry a zoom lens in the pocketbook. It only takes 15 seconds to swap lenses anyway.The 'intelligent auto' works well, making it easy to point_and_shoot in many conditions. The feature set is quite rich and pretty easy to learn, so it is easy to step up to do more with aperture, white balance, manual focus, etc.
