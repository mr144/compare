i got mine about a month ago, the picture qualities are quite acceptable but i have been bothered by a VERY MAJOR DESIGN FLAW which i wish to disclose here on amazon.com to all you users.  The position of the many bottoms are awful.  If the camera is front facing, you are hard pressed to hold it and grab it without hitting accidentally the 'video' button, or some of the other buttons such as exposures +/ buttons for increased / decreased exposures.  I have on a number of occasions hit these and then the video is running without my knowing, or that some exposures are  amessed up'.  Perhaps with a view to 'save space' so the camera can be small, they have been very tight with spaces, and i do not particularly have lard hands, in fact , i think my hands are regular to small size.  i also have used SLR's and also small mini cameras.  Hence i want you all to be very careful and do some shooting at store first before you decide on getting one.  It may not be suitable for you.
