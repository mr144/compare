I am very impressed with this camera. It exhibits no visible noise at ISO800 and still pleasantly looking photos at ISO1600 where it retains the color and contrast quite nicely even compared to entrylevel DSLRs. IBIS is very effective, using shutter speed 1/5 is a breeze  no more blurry pictures in low light. Together with Panasonic 20mm f1.7 lens EPL2 can sustain even the most demanding low light conditions with no flash. WB presents are very accurate. Use AWB most of the time except for artificial light conditions  switch to 'incadecent' and you are good (in rare cases 'fluorescent'). No more yellow cast images. Metering is very accruate; you would not need to make any exposure changes in most cases. The color rendition of this camera is similar to that of Canon's but does even better job with skin tones rendering. Great portrait camera. I have been using it for a few weeks now (bought it from B&H Photo though) and, honestly, it does not even have a lot of cons to brag about. I do not shoot videos so I do not even know if it is good at all. The camera is great for P&S folks who are not comfortable to do any tweakings  EPL2 works right out the box just like P&S delivering beautiful, professionally looking photos (just do not forget to switch WB from AWB to 'incadecent' in artificial light to avoid yello cast). If you currently own Canon S95 or anothe rtop of the line P&S  you have seen nothing yet. S95 does not even come close to breathtaking 'bokeh' or 'out of focus' backgrounds you can easily achieve with EPL2 not to mention extremely sharp looking photos. DSLR owners probably will not be surprised too much but P&S would truly appreciate the ease with which you can take those kind of pictures w/o any tweaking or even thinking.
