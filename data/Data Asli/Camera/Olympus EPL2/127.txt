The very first thing you will want to do upon setting up the camera is throw away the included strap.You are never going to get it attached to the camera. If you have high blood pressure, the attempt could be deadly.I just got back from a safari in Africa with the epl2. My results were spotty owing to the lack of a viewfinder.The camera is largely useless without one. In even moderate sunlight you cannot see the screen. Without glassesyou are completely out of luck. There will be no composing and little hint of the final shot until you get intothe shade with your glasses on. All you can do is point the camera in the general direction and hope for the best.The viewfinder is $240 bucks. Put that into the purchase decision.I am also not convinced that I would ever use any of the various 'art' settings as I do all of that sort of thing quickerand better on my computer. I would trade all the bells and whistles for a proper viewfinder. If you are a Mac user the offeredPenPal is not compatible. Olympus does not advertise this fact.I am shopping for another camera.
