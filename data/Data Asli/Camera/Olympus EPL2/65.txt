I have owned film SLRs, DSLRs and P&S (point_and_shoot) cameras stemming back to the 1990s. So, while I am not a seasoned pro with 40 years shooting experience, odds are that you are not either. And that is why this camera is for YOU.Many of the other reviewers have already commented on nearly all aspects of this fabulous camera, so I will skip the redundancy. I will merely add that this camera is a natural progression for people looking for either more control, better images, or lens selectionwhen upgrading from a P&S camera such as Canon, Panasonic, Nikon or other 'allinone' cameras. Alternatively, if you a family/candid shooter,  yet are shlepping around a huge DSLR that you find overly encumbering, this is a fabulous substitute. Five Stars.
