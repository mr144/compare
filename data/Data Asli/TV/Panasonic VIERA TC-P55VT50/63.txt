This review is for those who are stuck between either the Sony HX850, LG 8600-9600, or this Panasonic:Bought the Sony - would not turn on.  Replaced it with another Sony, has slight flashlighting/clouding issues (not horrible, but enough to bother for the price).Decided to bring it back for the 9600 as when the lights were turned off in pauls tv for me, the 8600 had tons of edge light bleed (really really bad).  You do not see that in a brightly lit store with full screen acctive.  9600 came in, picked it up.  Best looking TV on the market, but CNET was on the money.  Had the worst flashlighting of all 3 tv's.  There is a picture on the AVS forums of the flashlighting issue these if anyone wants to check it out. Girlfriend and I re-boxed it within 5 minutes of setting it up.Finally just decided to get the Panasonic on a whim. Never owned a plasma, always preferred LCD.  This thing is a big heavy but its just as thin as the other tv's and as pretty as the Sony.  It blew me away.  We have not stopped watching it.  Deep color, perfect uniformity.. ZERO FLASHLIGHTING!  CNET again was on the money with calling it best tv of 2012.  Easy as heck to use the smart features too.  Simple, modest interface.
