Keeping it simple.  Replaces my older 42&#34; TH-42PX60U, which had excellent picture quality for a 720P/1080i TV.Picture quality is excellent!Movies, Sports, Nightly programming, Cartoons and even non-HD channels all display nicely.Much better TV than the previous year's ST30, which is used in our basement in the kid's room - and I am not disappointed with that TV either.  We have not used the 3D capabilities on the VT50, as we have already been setup with the glasses on the ST30 - and they are not interchangeable (3D excellent on the ST30).TV is located in a fairly bright room with plenty of windows - and no issues as a result.I used the CNET picture settings over the THS built-in settings, but both provide excellent picture quality.I have no regrets after purchasing this TV. It is the best TV. It is the best TV. It is the best TV.
