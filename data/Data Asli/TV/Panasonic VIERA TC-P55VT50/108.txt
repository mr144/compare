This is the first time in my 35 years that I have not second guessed the money spent on a significant purchase.  This is the best TV I have ever owned. The picture quality out of the box is fantastic.  Once I calibrated it, it is even better.  HDMI cables are a must!BluRay picture is crystal clear.  I chose a plasma because I am a gamer, and again I am not disappointed. No scrolling issues or slowdown.Advertisements built in are annoying at first but they can be disabled and you'll never have to deal with them again. Netflix ready, and it works like a dream.Enjoy!
