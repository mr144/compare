This 55-inch Plasma unit is  a beauty and the picture it delivers is &#34; outstanding&#34; .  I thought my old 42-inch Sony Plasma was top-notch until I  set up this new Panasonic Viera .Amazon had it priced right and the delivery/set-up was better than I had expected.  I would give this product 5-stars with the caveat that a buyer should not expect too much in the way of 3-D viewing options.  There just are not that many 3-D programsavailable for viewing unless you buy a new Blue-Ray 3-D dvd player and rent or buy a 3-D disk.Thank you  Amazon  for making it easy to upgrade my viewing pleasures !!
