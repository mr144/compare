I received this TV as a warranty replacement for my VT30 last week. The VT30 only lasted 11 months before it died. The VT50 looks better when it is off since the screen goes closer to the edge then on the VT30. The net tools do work  better and are much faster.The sound quality of the VT30 blows away the sound on this TV. The VT50 sounds like a cheep clock radio. I compared the specs and the VT50 has only 18W as compared to 22W on the VT30. The VT30 sound was very good, to bad they cut cost on the audio section.The remote control feels and looks cheap as compared to the VT30. Another cost savings.In my opinion the TV30 had a much better picture. The colors may be a little truer on the VT50, to me the picture seams dim and dull. I have tried all the settings and the only one I can stand are the THX modes. I used vivid a lot for watching normal TV shows on the VT30 and it was very good. Vivid is useless on this TV, everything gets washed out.The VT30 came with a full manual, this one only comes with a small one and you need to go online or push the help button on the remote to get the manual. More cost savings.No 3D glasses, my VT30 came with one pair (they do not work on the VT50), more cost savings.In my opinion, I was much happier with the VT30 with both picture and sound.Update - I have read from others that this TV needs some break in time. I will update in a month to see if picture has improved.
