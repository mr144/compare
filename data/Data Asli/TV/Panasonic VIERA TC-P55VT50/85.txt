I ordered this television after reading many reviews about many different TV's.  I did not see any bad reviews about this one and many had this towards the top of their list.  I am very happy with the picture quality.  The black levels and contrast are great.I did have to order this tv twice on Amazon.  The first time did not go well.  The order was placed through Electronic Expo.  They were not easy to get in touch with.  The delivery process took a long time, and when I finally got the TV it was clearly a used product when I ordered it new.  I refused delivery and had it sent back.  Luckily Electronic Expo did not give me a hassle with accepting the TV back and giving me a full refund.  I tried again and this time made sure my order was placed through Amazon directly.  This time I did not have any issues.  The delivery service brought the TV into my house and opened it so I could inspect it.  It was in good order and I have been happy with the TV since then.
