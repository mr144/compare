I am going to start this review off by saying I am satisfied with this tv. I stress the term satisfied because I do believe there is room for improvement. I did not buy the tv from amazon but did go with a company a little cheaper online.I am running the tv along with directv and ps3.The tv from the start, turning it on, the menus, everything works fantastic. I put a blu ray in and wow. I waited to watch the Dark Knight Rises till I got this tv and It was amazing. The blacks are unbelievable.Now I come from a great history of Tv's. This being my first plasma. I currently have a 40in Sony XBR3, a 55in Sony HX829 and now a 65in Panasonic VT50. Bedroom, Living Room, Basement.The only downfall with this tv and why I am giving it a 4. Playing a HD Directv Channel I am not happy with the color. I tried different settings but nothing looks like my other tv's the color is not impressive and I am not getting that wow from watching the tv. Is there something I am missing here, maybe a setting someone can help me with? If you are watching a Blu ray movie I suggest getting a surround sound system. Please let me know if there is something I am missing. Would greatly appreciate it, then I can turn my review to a 5
