We have a 4 year old Panasonic Plasma and moved it to the newly built guest house and bought the 55VT50 to replace it in our living room. I turned it to THX Bright Room as many seem to like this setting in reviews.The first week I was concerned that we had taken a step back. Colors were not true, screen was darker than we were used to. Fuzzy picture. I re-watched an episode of King of Thrones and realized something was wrong. This is NOT how i remembered the show looking! Then I set it to Custom and started adjusting the settings to my liking. More brightness, more sharpness, vivid greens and blues. Saved my custom settings and now it is perfect. There were a bunch of pro settings but I left them alone. So, my suggestion here is just spend about 15 minutes trying out various custom settings while playing a favorite show, save those custom settings at the end and do not use any of the presets.
