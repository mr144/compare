My new Panasonic TC-P65VT65 was delivered on time and the crew made sure it came on and even set some of the setup menu items for me.  Took me a while to enter my 24 digit WEP address!  But once enterred, I have a 65 inch beautiful TV.  After setup I connected my OPPO DVD Blue Ray player running the CNET Color Slides and turned the contrast and brightness to a number in the 30's (was in the 50's).  Now I will let the slides run every night and watch no ESPN or Discovery Channel and try to zoom in to keep full random images on the screen until 150 hours of operation.  At this time I will set the Custom video settings to CNET's recommended settings for the TC-PV65VT50 .  I assessed the plasma screen for imperfections once the slides started.  There are no imperfections.  It is as beautiful of a HDTV and bragged about in the reviews and strongly recommend by CNET and Sound and Vision magazine, among others.  This is the best Plasma HDTV that can be purchased today and I am happy to be a new owner. More later, after the break-in and video setup.
