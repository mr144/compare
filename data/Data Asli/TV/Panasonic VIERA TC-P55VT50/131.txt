We got the Panasonic TC-P55VT50 tv yesterday and after around 4 hours of watching it, I must say it has the best tv picture I have ever seen!  Blacks are BLACK, and colors are strickingly vivid and detailed.  This tv replaced a 5 year old Sharp Aquos LCD tv and there is no comparison.  Shipping was fast, and on time.  Two guys brought the tv inside and assembled it very quickly; they obviously knew what they were doing.  Very professional.  With them still here, I plugged in the cable and a blu-ray player to make sure it worked, and it did, perfectly.  Even off, the tv is the nicest looking one I have ever seen, very classy looking.  This tv is very, very highly recommended!
