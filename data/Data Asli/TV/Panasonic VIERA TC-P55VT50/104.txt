Nothing bad to say about TV. Great pic. Set up easy. WiFi working well even with a fairly weak signal from my home network. Everything good you have read about this model. Unless you are some super videophile that can see beyond the usual human spectrum, I do not see how you could not like this picture.The small extra remote is kind of odd and do not really see a need. It has been discussed that it is sort of inconsistant in how well it works and I agree with that. The sound is adequate but nothing to bragg about which is fairly common on the large flat screens. The one feature I really like is the Viera network. I added a Panasonic Home Theater sound bar with subwoofer (which really did the job if you do not want to put up a full sound system) and a Panasonic blu-ray and they hooked right up to the TV and I can use the same remote for all of them.As with most HD TVs they do not work well with SD signals over cable. The pic is rough but watchable. I had this problem and used a wireless HD transmitter to get HD from my sate reciever without having to get anoher box. Worked very well.Only problem I had was with the delivary of the thing. I bought it through Buy Squad Inc. When the TV did not show up as scheduled they did answer my first few emails very quickly and even called me at home once. I thought that was great but when I still had no TV after another week, they completely ignored my multiple attempts to conact them. They have no phone number so you can only email. May not have been their fault, HomeDirectUSA can take the blame for that, but Buy Squad hired them and I would have liked a little better followup.
