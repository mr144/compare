I did a lot of research before buy this TV and finally bought it due to the positive reviews of the different web sites (CNET, Consumer Reports, Home Theater Magazine and others) about the image quality of this TV. I am Very happy with this TV because the great image quality, is the best I ever seen since the Pioneer Plasma that I saw in a Display demonstration about 5 years ago. This is my first Plasma TV since I owned before a Samsung LCD and there is a big difference, this Plasma is by far much better. I just used to watch movies in a light controlled environment. I have been watching the Harry Potter 8 movie collection and as you now this scenes are dark and I can enjoy clearly every detail in this scenes and the colors are amazing. If you like to see an excellent picture Image quality in a TV, then I have to tell you, this is the TV you are looking for, highly recommended. To Panasonic, Congratulation for an Excellent Image Quality in this TV.
