Love the picture. More than bright enough in daylight with no direct light on the screen. The only problem is that we watch a political channel that constantly displays its logo. The logo has burned in. It is only noticed on very light pictures of white or a light sky. The warranty specifically denies burn-in coverage. The tv has a scrolling bar to reduce the burn-in, but it has not helped. The tv also has a pixel orbiter feature, but it cannot function when THX Cinema is selected as the picture mode.I will be keeping the tv but wanted to provide a heads up to this problem.
