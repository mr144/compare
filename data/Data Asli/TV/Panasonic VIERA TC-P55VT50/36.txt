While this may not be the best value per dollar (ST and GT probably are, but even this is debatable given the price for 55vt50 was $1599 for a while), this TV still has the best quality picture of all the TVs currently on the market. It'll probably be surpassed by VT60 and ZT60, but you'll a) have to wait until they come out b) pay significantly more or wait even longer for prices to come down).  I really do not know what else to say...Maybe for those of you who are trying to decide between VT50 and GT50. In my opinion, VT offers slightly better picture (blacks seem nicer), but this is really not very noticeable. I think the biggest advantage of VT50 is that the screen is significantly less reflective than that of GT50, and that does make a difference to me. Basically, I would not go for VT50 over GT50 if price difference is big enough (this price difference fluctuates) for you to feel the financial hit or compromise on your audio set up, for example. Otherwise, VT50 is the way to go.P.S. GT50s I have returned seem to either buzz more than my new VT50 or VT50s fans drown out the annoying buzzing noise. Not sure...(my GT50 was a 50 inch,I am not sure if 55gt50 has the fans or not)
