Product was dead on arrival. I considered exchanging mine for a new one, but after dealing with Panasonic's poor customer service and learning that panel failures are common in Panasonic Vieras, I decided just to return it to Amazon for a refund. Amazon's customer service was excellent through the ordeal.
