I was an early plasma adopter.  Got a Pioneer 43&#34; that was very, very expensive at the time. But I did not want to spend less and risk being unhappy.  That was great TV but I eventually wanted bigger with 3D. I did months of research mostly on the AVS Forum. It was definitely useful, but those guys are crazy into it!  I ran a prep slideshow on the set and contacted a professional calibrator.  But after a couple of weeks, I could not see how a pro calibrator could make the picture any better!  The THX Cinema setting is sweet.  The blacks are much deeper than they were on the Pioneer.  Overall, could not be happier. My wife was not at all enthusiastic about the 3D.  But now I get, &#34;What? No 3D movie this weekend?&#34;
