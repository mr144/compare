I have had this TV almost a month now.  Delivery via Pilot went as scheduled on date and time window.  This TV has so many features: built in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, many adjustments for picture quality.  After a few tweaks the picture quality is amazing.  I even have the Viera remote app on my Kindle Fire HD.  It is the best TV. It works great.  On this app it has a browser that allows you to simply flick to TV what you are viewing on your Kindle.  Great for sharing videos with other family members.  Since this TV is on my home network I can even view pictures and play videos that are stored on my computer.  Without a doubt this is the best TV I have ever owned.
