Just like I will only buy pioneer elite AV equipment, I will only buy Panasonic plasmas.  This plasma is not only handsome but it had a fantastic picture. You can not go wrong with this plasma.  As far as I am concerned, panasonic has the best picture quality out there on their plasma line up.  Could not be happier, and I am very picky about my audio and video. The picture is fantastic even in well lit rooms.  I set it on cinema THX and it is excellent.  Bought this plasma and all my elite products at best buy so the manufacturers will honor the warranty, or I would have purchased through Amazon.
