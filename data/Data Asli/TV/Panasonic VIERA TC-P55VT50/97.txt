I am fairly selective when it comes to televisions and preferred to live with a tiny 38' Loewe Aconda CRT as my primary screen rather than compromise on picture quality for plasma or LCD TVs.  With the P65VT50, I say there is no compromise.  My 10+ year old Loewe recently bit the dust and I read enough positive comments about this TV to feel it was worth the gamble instead of springing for a repair.  Boy am I happy.  I now have a TV that is several times larger than the Loewe but with picture quality that is just as excellent.An example: A man in a dark navy shirt stands in front of a black backdrop: You immediately notice that his shirt is navy and that the background is black.  I looked at the same scene in a room where I have an older Samsung plasma and watched it again: the navy shirt and black backdrop look exactly the same.3D works well.  I did not appreciate having to drop another $140 for glasses (the set does not include any) but they do work extremely well.  I think the 3D experience is the same as what you see in an IMAX 3D theater.If you care about picture quality, my bet is you will love this TV.UPDATEI have noticed that the set has a fan that is sometimes audible.  Sitting 12 feet away, I can clearly hear the fan when my audio is turned down very low or when I pause playback or fast forward through commercials.  It is a mild high pitch sound, similar to what you might hear on a laptop computer.  It is not enough to bother me, but I am going to side with the other reviewers that say it is audible.UPDATE 2I purchased this under an Amazon promotion offering a $500 credit to your account within 7 days of the television shipping.  Indeed, on the 7th day after the TV shipped, I received a $500 credit applied to my account by Amazon.
