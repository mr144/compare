I give it 5 stars for picture quality alone. I use it solely as a monitor for watching movies and televised sports. The internet options are interesting, but I use AppleTV, and it has enough of this functionality already. The blacks are really quite phenomenal. This TV is better than Samsung, sharp, LG, sony , TCL, Toshiba or vizio. Colors are natural. Lots of control over noise reduction modes as well. Screen has a great deal of glare. I rarely have it on during the day, so it is not a problem for me, but YMMV.
