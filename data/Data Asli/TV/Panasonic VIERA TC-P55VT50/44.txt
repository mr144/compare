These comments are also posted as a reply to Anthony's comments: I purchased  the p55vt50 based on Anthony's review, Amazon's service, other reviewers and CNet detailed testing and comments (CNet included the Amazon link and the price was one of the lowest). Standard delivery by Pilot was quicker than I had expected and I watched the Super Bowl on the new set. Assembly of the pedestal was easy, startup of the set was simple with rapid connection to my home wifi. The picture is excellent although &#34;standard&#34; was a bit dim. I used &#34;custom&#34; and increased the brightness about 25 percentage points as the room has lot's of windows, although they are tinted. I did not need &#34;bright&#34; room as the image was too bright or my preference. Overall an excellent choice of TV
