First, What a great TV!!!!! I could not be happier.  Plenty of hook ups and works perfect.  It had a surface scratch on the screen which is the reason it was sold at a discount through the warehouse program.  I can not see the scratch unless the TV is turned OFF and you look at it at an exact angle.  Delivery guy was great, he brought it in the house, removed from the box, and turned it on to make sure it worked; he does not hook it up to cable or anything else, just makes sure the blue screen comes on and the setup menus show up.My only complaint is the warehouse program is not described very well.  After contacting them by phone I understood much better.  I would recommend that you call Amazon first to understand how it works.  My biggest surprise was there is no warranty at all, except for Amazon's 30 day satisfaction.  My experience is that &#34;reconditioned&#34; items have a reduced manufacturer warranty.  Not true through this program.
