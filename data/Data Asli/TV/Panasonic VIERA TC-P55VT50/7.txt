I agree with all the raving reviews about its outstanding picture quality. It has the best picture I have ever seen, but it has 2 of the drawbacks, plasmas are known for:(1) It consumes 275 Wt of power during operation. I knew this before I bought the TV, so I can live with that.(2) A much more serious problem: After 2 months I already noticed burn in symptoms. We like to watch news channels and our local Channel 2 constantly projects a high contrast white number 2 on a dark background, always on the same spot. After I switch to another channel, the 2 is still vaguely visible and it does not go away. This TV replaced an 8 year old Hitachi plasma that started to have this problems after 5 years. I am disappointed that the Panasonic TV already shows it after 2 months. What will it be after 1 year? I am thinking about buying a second smaller LCD to watch the news, not something I anticipated.
