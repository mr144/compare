This TV gives a stunning picture!  I have had flat panels before but the picture quality and particularly the dark blacks and excellent contrast are the best I have seen.  We watched one 3D movie (Hugo) and were amazed, but then that was new to us so nothing else to compare with.  I am over 65 and detecting some hearing problem, but the sound from the TV speakers is clear to me, so audio is very good, better than my home theater system for regular TV. Of course, for a surround sound Blu-Ray I defer to the home theater speakers.  I also love the additional remote with scroll wheel. The included wireless plug-in wi-fi device was easy to use and the set found my existing Centurylink DSL modem quikly.  We now enjoy good quality streaming movies and much more via Amazon Prime (highly recommended by the way).  A surprise was that this TV actually includes an internet browser!  It works too, just a little more cumbersome to use without a keyboard.  One note is that this is a plasma, so good viewing from any angle but noticeably a little more heat output which might be a factor in a small well insulated but poorly ventilated room .  Other than that, there's nothing to dislike about this TV!
