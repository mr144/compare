I agree with all the reviewers that this is the 'BEST' TV you can buy from the quality of the picture and several other factors. BUT, my rating is based on customer service and expected life of the product.My TV started to develop some glitches about a year after I purchased it. I called the customer service several times and every time they will walk me through a reset sequence which will fix the issue for couple of weeks and then the problems will creep in again. Finally, TV would not turn on at all. There is a little red light at the bottom of the TV which started to blink seven times. When I called the support they told me that this is diagnostic light and it means that circuit boards have failed. I searched internet I see if this is a one off problem. Unfortunately, I found out that this is a common problem a lot of Panasonic plasma TVs have developed the 'blink' of death. Now that the TV is no longer under warranty I have to pay $121 just to get a technician to give me estimate to figure out if it is worth to fix the TV. I was alos told that what I pay for diagnosis cannot be applied towards the final cost of repair. Panasonic FAIL!It is up to you to decide what you want from a TV1) The BEST TV which will be dead as soon as warranty is over2) A very good TV that will last (NOT Panasonic)
