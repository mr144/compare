The Good ...- Nice looking set- Easy setup- Good picture qualityThe Bad ...- The Touchpad used for the on-screen keyboard and navigating the Internet is clumsy and too sensitive. Trying to enter text using the Touchpad is a chore. Moving the mouse arrow over the on-screen keyboard to select letters is difficult to master. If you hover over a letter too long the letter is added to your text box and then you need to fumble your way to the backspace key hoping you do not add more letters along the way. Entering a simple web address can take minutes. An external keyboard is needed.- The Internet is not a separate Input Source. Therefore, you cannot toggle between the Internet and another Input Source (like Cable or a DVD player) without starting over again on the Internet side. This means you cannot pause a NetFlix movie or interrupt a web browser search to view something on one of the other Input Sources without starting over.- There is no Picute-in-Picture (PIP) or Split Screen feature. This seems to be a dying feature but one I use all the time on my older Panasonic.- There is only one Component Input connection on the back.- There are no Output ports.- A web camera would be nice for Skype so you do not have to mount one on the tv.- 3D Glasses are not included.
