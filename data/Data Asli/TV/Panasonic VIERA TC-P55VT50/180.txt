I wa not supposed to even have this tv but due to some negligence on the part of the store I was going to get the VT30 from (they said they had them in stock still and found out after my delivery date passed and I had paid that the TV was unavailable) I was able to get this 55 inch set for the amazing price of 1699.00 (+ tax =1801.00) which is what I had paid for the VT30. Needless to say I am so very happy that I was unable to get the VT30 as this tv is AMAZING. I have got to agree with the guy from CO the blacks in this tvs picture is simply unreal. I do not know that you could make one any better than this. Without going on and on about this TV as I am sure it will get many great reviews I can say I would have gladly paid the full price for this set as it is just that good. The lack of 3D glasses is upsetting but I knew I was not getting any from the get-go. Plus the new ones are cheaper than last years so I do't mind getting them. Have not used the 3D yet so I will need to update my review when I use it. This is hands down the best tv of 2012 and I have not been able to leave it alone since I got it on the 12th. I have been waiting since feb. 3rd to get a tv so I am so happy to have it. It is better than Samsung, sony, sharp or even LG tv. Also gaming on this tv is so realistic as well as regular bluray movies. You feel as if you are watching it in real life. So many things I have been missing with my older LCD. If this is going to be setup in a home theater you better have some good speakers and a good receiver to showcase this beauty though I do not see why you did spend so much money if you were not going to do that. All in all I am tottally thrilled with this TV and SO glad I was able to get this instead of the VT30. Go buy one NOW! Ca not wait for football season to get here now!
