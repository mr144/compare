First the sound - sounds like a cheap transistor radio inside a glass case, it is so muffled, it is mostly unintelligible. The sound is only tolerable on my stereo  The set is less than 4 months old. But I know what my favorite channels are - THEIR LOGOS ARE BURNT INTO THE SCREEN!!!  And Panasonic - the major run-around. Do not buy the story that burn in is no longer an issue. I was real careful what was on the screen during the first 100 hours - although officially, there is no break in period.
