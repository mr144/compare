First off, GREAT picture, better than my brother's Bravia, which has back-lighting picture control. But enough praise--WAY too much money for a television (although it is a beautiful one as far as looks go), especially if you are thinking, &#34;Wow! I can sit in the Barcalounger and surf the 'net!&#34;Wrong.The interface is horrid: using arrow-keys on the remote to select letters for a url...and forget streaming: the bandwidth is all being prioritized, privatized and locked-down for the financial industry's benefit by cable providers (Comcast is a Federal Government &#34;cable advisor&#34;, no conflict-of-interest there), router manufacturers, Google, YouTube, OS and especially driver-updates, Flash and Java. Once your pattern is known, Panasonic's proprietary browser will lock you out. Or it could be your cable-provider's modem. Or your router (beware Belkin! Use an open-source router like LinkSys), although it is hard to troubleshoot who's clamping-down your access when every gateway is doing its best to make you pay more money and give away more of your info to a third-party...and a fourth, and a fifth, ad nauseum...I just keep blasting searches until I get a stream that works...This is much easier: computer &#62; HDMI &#62; TV  or, PS3 &#62; HDMI &#62; TV. With a computer, you can use a wireless keyboard and toss the remote.Let's be clear about one thing: the media-creators are not getting more money, just the people who sell it...and re-sell it and re-sell it. I know, I was a musician. My royalty checks are about $12.98 once in each month not ending in a &#34;b&#34;. Providers are not only stealing OUR Internet (tax-payers + DoD = DefenseAdvanceResearchProjectAdministration - D = ARPA = ARPA Net = Internet) but denying the open-sharing on peer-to-peer networks, which is the only true &#34;payment&#34; for those who make stuff they want others to see.The reason this TV is just a TV and Not All That? Money. Cable/cellphones/computer will not share with each other, either.Big Brother is officially here: YOU are one big mass o' data....all your habits are being tracked with every click. If what you are doing is not to Someone's liking, you will be shut down.Happy TV viewing!
