I bought this soon to be discontinued set from Paul's TV where they would give you $500 for your old set, regardless of condition, and it turned out to be $1497, new. Am very happy with the purchase but I cannot get the lossless formats (Dolby True HD, DTS Master Audio) that I did when I had the JVC LCD since there is no HDMI output that I connect to my Denon receiver but outside of that, I am very happy with an HDTV which Sound & Vision called 'state of the art' and the 3D is amazing since watching some of the IMAX documentaries and sport events.  Too bad Panasonic does not have this outlet.
