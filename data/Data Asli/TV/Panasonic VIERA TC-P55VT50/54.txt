Nice little trick raising your price $300 dollars a week before the Super Bowl. Unfortunately for you I have been keeping an eye on your tv a and your nemesis Samsung which is a 60 inch plasma e7000 series rated very well or better depending on who's giving the rating. Well you can bet your bottom dollar Im buying a Samsung come January 31th.  3 reasons:  first, I get paid on that date, second, on the next day Arizona starts charging us taxes I stand to save roughly 9% in tax, and third, SAMSUNG IS $400 freaking dollars less than you and 5 inches bigger!  And how dare u raise the price of your tv when new models come out any day now.
