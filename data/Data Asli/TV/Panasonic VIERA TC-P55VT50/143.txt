amazon had it priced at 3299.99 then raised the price 50 dollars more the following day but well worth it imho.I just took the 3299.99 price point and got best buy to dip to 3300 flat, out-the-door with free next day delivery because I am still an impulsive buyer in the end.with that said, this tv is the best. I always go with plasmas because they are in essence the best colors in the market. led/lcd gives off a generic/fake look while plasma stays true.the difference between this and the gt50/st50 is the refresh ability while watching live sports. I highly recommend this over the other panasonic version if you are going to watch live sports, otherwise save your money and get the gt50/st50. They are great value tv's that will give you the same picture as the vt50.
