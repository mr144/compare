I needed to upgraded my old Pioneer Elite 930 and after a few comparisons I was nervous that it would be tough to find a replacement with at least comparable picture quality.  This TV is amazing!  I love the new design of the bezel over the klunky feel of the vt30.Picture quality is excellent.  User interface is also pretty snappy.I do not use the speakers on the TV as it is part of a larger surround sound system so I cannot comment on their quality.I knew this did not come with 3D glasses either which was not a decision factor so be warned.The only complaint I have was with the ad that shows up each time when you would turn on the TV.  From what I have read this is new to all Panasonics this year but can easily be turned off in the settings.I highly recommend this TV.  Very happy with my purchase.
