I bought this TV to replace a 7 year old panasonic plasma that I absolutely loved.  I struggled to decide between this and a Sony LED LCD.  In the end I bought this and am very happy.  The TV looks great on the wall and the picture is fantastic.  Sound is sub-par but tolerable.The TV's presets are very good with little tweeking needed to get a great picture.This is a great TV and is a good deal.  Highly recommended.
