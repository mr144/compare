The delivery guy brought the unit in and set it up.  I kept walking around it and saying 'This is just CRAZY COOL!'  It replaced a large rear projection TV and they are not even in the same ballpark.  Still working out the settings etc.  Rented 'The Journey 2 Mysterious Island' through Amazon video stream to take her for a test drive.  The colors and picture clarity are stunning!  It also seems to do very well with light from side windows.
