Simply put, this is the best tv you can buy today! If you are serious about picture quality, there is nothing else that compares. Exceptional contrast and blacks. When watching a widescreen movie, the black bars blend in with the slim black bezel. The colors are perfect and there is brightness to spare! Seriously! If you think you do not want plasma because they are not bright enough, try it and see. Mine is in a sunlit living room with white walls and I have plenty of brightness to spare. Also, the anti-glare is probably the best I have ever seen, reflections are no problem whatsoever! The overall design is beautiful. I really can not say enough about it. Also, I purchased for much less than the listed price and considering how good it is I think the price is very reasonable. Highly recommended!
