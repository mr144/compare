This is the only television I have seen that has a picture that compares to the Pioneer Kuro my son owns. To me, it is much better than the Panasonic GT model I had which I sent back to Amazon. Should have ordered this one first, ordering the GT cost me about $380 for restocking charge to Amazon. I did not read the return policy.
