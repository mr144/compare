Panasonic plasmas have always been top notch and this one is no exception. The THX picture modes were stunning right out of the box and I was also able to create custom modes using tweaks provided by several home theater magazines to produce even better results. I can not wait to get this beauty professionally calibrated.Standard definition broadcasts... not so hot, but who buys an HD TV to watch standard definition programming anyway?I would highly recommend this machine to anyone wishing to purchase a plasma television.
