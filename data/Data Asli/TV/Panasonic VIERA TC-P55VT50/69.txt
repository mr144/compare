I scanned various websites that reviewed flat screens as well as going to stores and looking at the different units.What I wanted was a flat screen that gave a good color and looked smooth like my previous tube TV, not stark and flat.The plasma TV's seemed to give blacker blacks and smoother colors, so I chose PLASMA.  Next I wanted the best rated plasma while maintaining a reasonable price.  All that said, I settled on the Panasonic VIERA, even though I was a little skeptical of Panasonic since you do not see them in most stores.I am extremely happy with the unit.  It more than beats my expectations.  It was easy to set up and it has the added feature of being 3-D.  I just hope it lasts as long as my previous TV.
