The Panasonic P55VT50 was as good as advertised and we are exremely pleased with all features of the set. We have had the opportunity to try out the 3D capacity and was surprised how much we both enjoyed the added feature. For me, the idea was to improve my hockey viewing with the high def HD and Saturday night in Canada has never been better. THoroughly enjoy the set and highly recommend the same to anyone- especially as the price is now coming down.JackW.
