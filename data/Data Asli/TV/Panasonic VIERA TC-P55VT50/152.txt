5 stars for the product.2 stars for delivery.I am no videophile and the numerous other customer and webpage reviews about this product are accurate.  You should have no hesitation about purchasing this TV.  It is beautiful just sitting off in the room and is the standard by which all other plasmas should be compared to this year.  This review is mainly about the delivery service.The TV arrived on the day promised, but 5 hours ahead of the scheduled time.  Luckily I was home.  When the truck arrived, there was one very friendly delivery man who unfortunately did not have anyone to help him bring in the TV.  He said 'sorry, but times are tough you know'.  As I was feeling like being helpful, I assisted him in carrying the TV off of the truck and into the house.  We tested the TV upstairs and took it into the basement.  Since he was alone this was not going to be 'white glove' delivery as promised on Amazon.com.  I had to ask him to help me install the stand and he obliged and did not appear too put out by this.  Then after I washed by hands we moved the TV onto the stand.  The delivery man's hands were literally black with dirt and dust and he put a really nice sweaty palm print on the screen while helping me out.  Luckily I had some no lint, soft towels handy to clean this off.Amazon.com should not promise or imply 'white glove' delivery if the companies they contract out to do their work for them do not provide this service reliably.  Others appear to have different experiences.  I think the delivery man was 5 hours early because he wanted to end his day early.  Of the 14 deliveries he had that day, there were only 3 more after mine and this was at 10 am.  My time was supposed to be between 3-6 pm.The price and discounts that amazon.com offers cannot be beat by many. I did find a local store in Denver, CO (Listen Up) that matched the price, but with no tax I thought I did give amazon a shot.  This will probably be the last time for items like this.
