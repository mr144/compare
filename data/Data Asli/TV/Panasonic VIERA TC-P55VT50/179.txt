This is a fabulous TV that is an improvement over the 2011 VT30 series.  The 3-D display is awesome; you need to buy the TY-ER3D4MU glasses to view 3-D content.  I made the mistake of buying it from another supplier that used a low-bid delivery service; big mistake, buy it from Amazon and get premium delivery service and return priveleges.
