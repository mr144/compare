This is the best picture I have seen yet.  I also have a Sony Bravia, and I prefer the plasma.  I would say that if you do a lot of daytime viewing in a sunny room the backlighted LED Bravia that Sony sells might be a better choice, but even then this plasma would be spectacular.  Panasonic also has the lowest problem issue of all tv brands on Consumer's Reports, and Panasonic states a 100,000 hour life before losing half the brightness.  One important caveat- make sure you get the 3D glasses that work via Bluetooth, NOT IR (the latest VIERA glasses, or others).  The 3D is great, but there is not much content yet.  The simulated 3D mode actually adds some depth to the picture, but not enough to bother using the glasses, so I would only recommend using them with 3D native broadcasts.  Directv has a dedicated 3D channel, and watching a football game is eerie because you feel like you are there.
