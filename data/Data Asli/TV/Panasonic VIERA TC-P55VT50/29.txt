For the price, the picture quality, and the features...this TV is an incredible masterpiece. Although just missing the Pioneer Kuro in picture quality, you'll see that it comes quite close, just read the professional reviews out there. 3D looks amazing, Blu Rays look just as incredible, and HD programs are just as crisp depending on the signal being broadcast from your cable provider. Very impressed with this plasma so far.
