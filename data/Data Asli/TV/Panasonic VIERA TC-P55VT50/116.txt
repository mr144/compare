Coming from an all-Sony line-up after hearing rave reviews on Panasonic's flagship VT series, I expected a lot from it from the get-go.  Picture quality was just as expected, great, no surprises there, but it takes more than just beautiful pictures to satisfy high-end video enthusiasts.  First and foremost, you'll notice that the TV's fit and finish is not up to scratch when compared to the build-quality of Sony's XBR series, manufacturing gaps exist all throughout; the metal surrounds do not spell high-quality; the screen looks grey when turned off, unlike Sony's, which turns totally black and blends well with the edges, and looks just as good when it is off as it does when it is on.  The stand does not feel solid, although the base finish looks cool and resists fingerprints.  The remotes are of no-frills design, which for this price-point, should have been made with better materials and integrated with more features.  Lastly, the input/output panel juts out toward the side, making cables, especially thick HDMI varieties hard to keep from view; this part should be relocated to the lower-middle area, then either facing the back or down.
