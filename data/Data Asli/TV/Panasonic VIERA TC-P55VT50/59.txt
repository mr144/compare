I enjoy the plasma set, its a great set, unfortunately the shipper they used was awful. It took me several weeks to get my set. If it was not for Crawford superstore having to call them I probably would never have gotten it. They even offered to give me 100 if I do not refuse it which I never got. NEVER EVER USE TRISTATE FREIGHT
