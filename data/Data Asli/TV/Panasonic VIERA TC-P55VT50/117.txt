gamers beware, i recently bought this tv and initially loved it. but after a few months i began to notice some burn in from my xbox. i only played during the weekends for a few hours and began to notice that the residual xbox game screens would not go away. i tried using the built in screen wiper, which supposedly was suppose to clear the left over images with no luck. called panasonic and they basically told me sorry, we do not cover burn in and they cannot do anything about it. do not buy if you plan on using for gaming. actually i did pass on panasonic plasmas all together. if i can prevent one person from making my mistake i did feel better about my experience.
