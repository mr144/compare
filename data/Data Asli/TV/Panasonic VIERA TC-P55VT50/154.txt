I recently purchased this TV to replace a 65' Toshiba RPTV in my home theater.  Picture quality (via Cinema THX) is 'almost' perfect right out of the box.Anyone who is concerned about having a large TV delivered via a freight carrier should not be worried.  My set was delivered via Pilot and they did a great job (unlike the disaster when Best Buy delivered my the 65' Toshiba).
