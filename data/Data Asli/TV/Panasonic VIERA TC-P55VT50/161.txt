Like everyone else says, you get the best picture money can buy. Is a Kuro or Sharp Elite better? Have not seen either, but you can not get a Kuro and I personally do not feel like paying the same amount as a decent used car as I should a tv. For the majority of people out there, the VT50 is truly the best tv available. You get full viewing angles, pitch blacks and very little to no motion blur. I returned a 70' Sharp for this one. The Sharp does not come close to this one, and really if just going for size, just pick up a projector. The 3D on this Panasonic (and my 55ST30) are excellent and worth the cost of glasses. I was worried about plasma buzzing, but unless you turn the tv to mute and stick your head behind the screen, you hear absolutely nothing. Even then, it is very hard to hear it. Also, if you like the LCDs soap opera effect, this is the only plasma that I know of that has that option (I love it, most leave it off).I did have a couple minor things that I would have liked with this tv, but nothing that would make me hesitate for purchase. First, the single sheet of glass is cool, but the edges are still too thick compared to some other tvs out there. for the price of this, the picture should be 'floating.'  Also, I can still see some motion blur in very rare scenes. If a character is moving quickly in front of leafy trees or grass, you see a faint bit of blur. Nothing compared to a LCD, but do not let people tell you there is NO blur.Finally, shop around and refuse to pay full price. I was able to get this tv and three pair of the Panasonic 3D glasses for under $3k. Work it just as if you are buying a car.
