I have had this TV for about a month; Panasonic is supposed to release a new model in Spring 2013.  I love everything about the set except: there is some obvious ghosting with 3D images, most often when there is sharply defined white next to black.  Hopefully they'll correct this with the newer models, but I probably will not spring for one at the price this sells for.
