Most Valuable Plasma! Wow this set is the Real Deal right out of the box. I have been researching (my thing) HD TV's for 8+ years and was not fortunate enough to be able to afford a Pioneer KURO but this set is amazing at less than half the price! I know, right. I wanted the best set on the market and waited for the right price for me to be able to purchase this set and I suggest you do the same, no matter what model you decide for yourself. Give this one a spin at your favorite Big box store and wait for your perfect price, you will not want any other Set in your room!
