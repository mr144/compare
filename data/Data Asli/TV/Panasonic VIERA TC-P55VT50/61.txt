After 7 months the tv has been problem free. The picture quality is amazing! Vivid colors and sharp images. Picture quality from blue-ray disk movies is stunning!  Even in bright rooms the picture can be seen fine, but you will get window reflections etc. because of the glass front.The VIERA INTERNET link has worked perfectly with NETFLIX with no problems. Even The speaker sound and volume are better than the previous older model but still could be better. You will need a good surround sound system for your blue-ray movies. The remote is excelllent. Large buttons that are easy to see and use and light up when needed. PANASONIC hits a home run with this tv. THANKS PANASONIC!!
