I have had this TV (TC-P65VT50) for about a year and have tried every setting, but it is just not bright.  I have 3 year old LCD that looks way better.  I get that the darks are darker, but the whites are gray at best.  Stupid to get talked into this TV versus the Samsung 70/80.  I did sell it for $1000 and spend the rest of the money for a good TV.
