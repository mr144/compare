I bought the TV on Amazon after researching several LED/LCD and Plasma sets for the last year (some previous models). I decided to go with the Panasonic TC-P55VT50 because of I wanted the best possible picture for my money and I was not disappointed. The picture on this set is amazing! I did compare with several other TVs I was researching at a local store that happened to carry them all and It took less than 30 seconds to see the difference, even with the normally bad settings the stores use (although it did look as if the store had optimized these sets). Solid, well built set with plenty of features and the best picture I have ever seen on a television of any kind.
