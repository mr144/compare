We ordered this TV and after having it a few days, I decided it was just too large for our living room.  So we contacted Amazon and they walked us through the return process which was completely hassle-free.The freight company employees came and repacked it with all the packing materials which we had prudently saved.  After several days, we were notified by e-mail that Amazon had received it and that our account would be credited for a full refund which it was within a couple days.  Even the return shipping was free.It was a really positive experience for us - the purchase and subsequent return.  I would recommend purchasing from Amazon to anyone; their return policy is very friendly.The TV itself was outstanding; if you are looking for the best TV on the market, in my opinion this one is it.  I do not have any negative comments about it whatsoever.
