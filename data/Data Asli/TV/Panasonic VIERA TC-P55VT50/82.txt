Great TV, only shame is this TV does not support MKV's with DTS audio.  When steaming from a DNLA media server this TV will not play DTS audio.  I would suggest everyone contact Panasonic support to ask them to add DTS support in the next firmware.go here [...] support  scroll down to the bottom and ask question.I give this TV 4 stars due to do not having support for higher end audio formats for DNLA media streams.
