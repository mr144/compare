I was reluctant to get an HDTV because I did not want to sacrifice the great picture of my old - but great - CRT TV. I was at one time looking at a Pioneer KURO, but it was too expensive for me. This TV appears to be just as good as the Pioneer, and I do not miss my CRT at all. That said, as there's so many glowing reviews - which I agree with - I did instead like to focus on a few negatives and other points:- Dithering. The green and/or red snow you see in dark areas when you get up close to the TV is normal. You'll see it to some degree on other plasma brands, but I am still not crazy about it, as I can sometimes see it from a normal viewing distance, and still harbor fears that my TV is broken (even though Panasonic support and others have assured me otherwise).- Upscaling from 720p to 1080i is not good. When I let the TV do this upscaling, instead of my TiVo, the picture looks a bit like a cubist painting, with blotchy colors and lost detail, especially on faces. I am glad my TiVo does a much better job, but was surprised a TV of this price and caliber was so bad with this.- When I had questions about my TV, after numerous calls to Panasonic support I was unable to speak with someone who had first-hand experience with and knowledge of the TC-P55VT50.- I have found image retention to happen pretty easily, but also that it disappears just as easily, just from watching non-static video.
