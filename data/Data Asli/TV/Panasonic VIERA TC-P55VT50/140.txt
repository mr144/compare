This replaced an 8year old Sony rear projection Bravia LCD set and of course was a spectacular upgrade and 5' size increase.  We are as wowed with the picture quality improvement as with the original change from standard to HD.  Went plasma based on CR's high test score and am very pleased.  Picture sharpness is amazing and colors are very lifelike and this is at any angle of view.  The ability to show unblurred action actually shows up some movie stuntwork and is really something for sports.  TV shipped on time by Amazon's selected shipper who brought set into selected room and tested for operation before leaving.  It was a real no brainer to hook up to Audio, Playstation, and cable box using HDMI cables.  I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 55 inch set. I have had no buyers remorse on this one.I am not really interested in 3d but will go back and revisit the internet capabilities in the future.  I would want this set even if I never used these features because of the strong picture performance.  The onboard sound would probably satisfy my wife but I feel an audio system with subwoofer is a must for maximum enjoyment.
