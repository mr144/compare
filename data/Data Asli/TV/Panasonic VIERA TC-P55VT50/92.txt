Great quality and only 3/4&#34; wider than earlier Panasonic 50&#34; (much narrower bezel), but I was almost ready to return the unit when I first turned on based on what appeared to be a dim picture; adjusting the default setting fixed the issue, but even in a dimly lit basement it initially appeared rather muted out of the box. Beware using wall mounting bracket from predecessors that were much deeper - the old bolts that attach the TV to the bracket mount are so long you can impinge the back of the screen. Net, net though I am glad I purchased and the resolution is wonderful.
