We bought our first P55VT50 in September 2012 from Best Buy. I did done a LOT of research and felt comfortable with the VT50, as all the reviews indicated it was the best performing plasma overall for this year. I did seen a few comments regarding brightness fluctuation on the 2011 units, however, it supposedly had been fixed on the 2012 units. Yes, I said supposedly. It's not fixed. The short version is that Viera telephone support could not diagnose the problem ( we spent a lot of time changing a lot of settings - made no difference ) and then had an authorized srevice person come out to look at the unit, since they had 'no idea' what the problem was. The service person came out and basically said he did never seen anything like it before. He ordered and installed a new 'A' board ( that controls just about everything in the unit ) and.......same thing. So, I asked for a replacement unit, figuring maybe this was a fluke. Panasonic said no, they would refund our money instead and take back the unit and we could buy another unit if we wanted to. Well, the second unit arrived today ( 12/20/12 ) and..........it is WORSE THAN THE FIRST. Yup. In dark scenes, the black level jumps all over the place, sometimes several times within a few seconds. Bright scenes ( like basketball ) will get brighter and gradually decrease to the original level or just drop back down ( no, it is NOT the flash strobes - happens all the time ). So, the unit is going back to BB, who matched an internet price BTW, of $1818. Their store price was $2499. Great deal. And we'll probably get a Samsung or Sharp. Also, there's a law company, Abington Cole (abingtonlawdotcom), that's looking for people to join a possible class action suit against Panasonic. Guess I'll call them tomorrow. It's a great unit when it works and then there's the rest of the time. Caveat emptor.
