Received on Friday, set it up on Saturday, watched the game on Sunday with a lot of people at our Superbowl party.  The picture was superb out of the box.  I know of the break in time but can it that much better? Every one was amazed by the picture quality.  I never thought I would buy a plasma TV but this TV tops the list of all the TV models I looked at. This TV is the best. This TV is the best.
