The Panasonic Viera VT50, is definitely worth the hype. The picture is perfect, but the HD channels are even better. The TV is not only attractive but very functional. The 2D to 3D up conversion is incredible but do recommend only doing this when watching the HD channels the regular channels are not as crisp and defined. The TV is heavy but thin and easier to move than you would think. The mouse like remote does take some time getting used to but is definitely smaller than the other button remote and more ergonomic for your hands and you do get both with the TV. I never really wanted a plasma Tv since they were never true HD TV's but this is the best of both worlds 600hz for true Gaming and 1080P for true HD and a well designed smart tv as well.
