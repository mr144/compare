Ok, I have got to admit it.....it has been about 7 years since I ventured into the HDTV market.  The last high def TV I purchased was a big box floor unit that was 'cutting edge' at the time!!!  LOL  Well, let me just say that the VT50 is BY FAR the most cutting edge HDTV I have EVER seen.  If you are going to purchase a plasma then this unit has got to be the one you take a really, really hard look at.  I do not regret for a second dropping over $2k on this baby.  It is worth every penny and then some.  If you can find one (good luck with that!!!) then you need to grab it and run because you will be happy you did!!!  It has just about every bell and whistle you can imagine and for the gamers out there....the XBox 360 graphics have never looked better.  I have yet to try the 3D on this TV but if the 2D picture is any indication then the 3D will not disappoint either.  Bottom line is this....if you are SERIOUS about buying a QUALITY HDTV set then look no further than the VT50.  I know I did not and I am very happy with my purchase.
