I was concerned about all the background about plasmas, even modern ones, but after performing the 150 hour break-in routine with slides, I am consistently blown away.My buddy's $2000 Samsung LED/LCD looks washed out compared to the excellent use of contrast and color in the panasonic.video gamers - The longest I have gone with a &#34;static&#34; image would have been about 4-5 hours of Far Cry 3 and about 3 hours of GTA 4 -- neither games' HUDs left anything whatsoever. (Also, I replayed Uncharted 3, a real 1080p game, on this on this tv and holy crap). I used the settings from CNET after the break in period (motion smoothing OFF) and notice no issues whatsoever. TV was made - even games - to look like this and adding any smoothing just ruins things. I did experiment a little in far cry 3 with the smoothing, and it was distracting.apple tv / netflix users - I walk out of the room for 5-10 minutes on occasion, leaving the menus on screen. Apple tv's screen saver kicks on by then so no worries there. No issues to speak of.over-the-air HDTV - watching the latest NFL playoff games with buddies turned out perfect. Everything was sharp and vivid, but not blown out like the samsungs. (no artifacts either but I am close to town and get a good signal)
