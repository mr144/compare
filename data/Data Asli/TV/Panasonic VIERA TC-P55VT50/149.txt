Needed to replace a 60' Sony Rear Projection TV. Went to a couple of review sites and decided on the Panasonic P65VT50. The setup was very simple and the stand was easy to put together. The picture is fantastic. The TV has a lot of features, internet ready, Netflix, etc. I may be replacing our family room 50' Plasma with this one soon.
