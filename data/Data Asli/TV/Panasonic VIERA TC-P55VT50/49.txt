I have not been able to turn on the TV and will adjust rating and product once I get a chance to do so.  However, Amazon's Enhanced Shipping is worse then Best Buy's or any of the local stores - who will actually deliver the product to the room you need the TV and help with putting it on the stand.  Pilot Freight was used by Amazon to deliver this product and Pilot uses subcontractors who will only drop off the TV on the main floor of the premesis.  The would not assist in getting it on the stand and did not plug the TV in to determine whether it works.  Pilot would not deliver the TV to the basement where I needed it and I had to contact Amazon who had to contact Pilot who, after 45 minutes got the guys to take the box/TV to the basement.  They left the TV on the floor, packed up the box and left.  I now have to find a way to set up the TV on the stand - if it breaks, then I am returning the product.
