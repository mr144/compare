When I decided I was ready to buy a new television, I knew I had a lot of options. The VT50 by Panasonic is the best TV on the market today. I got some incredible expert advice after reading reviews and owner's opinions at HighDefJunkies. They have two of the best professional calibrators in the country who post about and discuss televisions. One of them even provides members with settings to get the most out of their new diplays!
