i purchased the 65' vt50 eight months ago after selling my vt30 plasma. i have to say that the vt50 is a excellent tv as far as picture quality, better than the vt30. as far as watching the tv in a bright room it is almost impossible. if watching a football game during sunday afternoon i'll go upstairs in my spare bedroom and watch the game on my 40' sony, no big deal. in life there is alway's a trade off. i really do not plan on getting it calibrated so i purchased the ' wow ' dvd and did my own calibration. after following the instuctions i have to admit the picture is flawless as far as i am concerned. as far as sound, i have my sunfire ribbon speakers hooked up to my pioneer elite receiver and the sound is excellent, better than a movie theater. ( my opionion ) i also have the tv hooked up to direct tv which i feel is much better than cable. the picture seems to be much smoother and cleaner than cable, also more vived. as far as picture quality verus led or lcd, i feel the plasma gives you a better over all better picture. again, my opinion. yes, the led picture is somewhat brighter than the plasma, but in the evening the plasma seems like your right there. almost like a photogragh. thank you for your time. bvd
