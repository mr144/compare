I have seen a lot of reviewers stating that they were unsatisfied with the picture or that it was not as good as their Samsung or sharp. Out the box this is true, also if you only adjust the basic picture settings and not the professional ones you wont get any where near the potential of this unit. This set is not geared toward the average consumer DO NOT PURCHASE if you just want a plug and play television.
