Thr vieracast feature forces ads down your throat. There is no way to get rid of them. I hate ads, espically when the item displaying the ad was something I paid for!...this really sucks and I hope they figure it out quick. They also track your internet movement because hidden deep in the menus is a small check box to opt out of targeted advertisements. Piece of crap TV when its like a talking billboard on my bedroom wall!.... what's next, is it going to turn itself on and play ads when it knows im home.....  buy anything else and show them its NOT ok to start this. The future is now people and YOU CAN'T be ok with this sort of stuff. Ads are taking over our lives and it is out of hand. Completely out of hand.
