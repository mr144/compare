I purchased this in Mid December and requested a delivery date a couple of weeks later due to vacation issues.  I requested a later time delivery but would recommend to others that they consider doing an earlier delivery if possible.  The TV was on a truck all day (7 hours) in 30 degree weather so when it was unpacked there was a layer of condensation on the screen and the tv was very cold to touch.  The delivery man was very pleasant about it and warned me not to turn it on for at least a couple of hours (the delivery typically includes you turning on the tv before signing so I signed the paperwork indicating this was not safe).  I wiped down the tv screen and left it standing for a few hours as recommended.  I am happy to say that it has worked well with a great picture quality.  I would characterize the sound as reasonable on the set alone.The small banner ad the presents when you turn it on does not bother me (given that the tv is nothing more than a billboard).  Directions to remove can be found here [...]I am not a big fan of the accessory remote.  I have not found a great way to use it and it does not seem that responsive.  Maybe I am missing something.
