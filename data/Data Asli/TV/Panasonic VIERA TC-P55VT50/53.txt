The TV is exceptional.  It surpasses all of my expectations.  The delivery was also very good.  The TV was delivered exactly on time and in perfect condition.  The delivery guys unboxed and set things up, and even offered to put on booties before coming into the house.  I did give the TV and the delivery five stars.Amazon was a completely different story.  I did give them zero stars.  I purchased the TV from Amazon because of an offer for a $500 credit on future purchases from Amazon.  The offer clearly stated that the credit would be available seven days after the item was shipped.  When seven days passed with no credit, I contacted Amazon.  First they claimed there was a &#34;technical issue&#34; and that the credit would not be made available for another month.  Next, they offered me a $10 credit for the inconvenience of waiting a month for the $500 credit.  Several days and seven emails later, they finally admitted that the offer promised a credit within seven days, and my account was credited.  I will not ever consider buying an item this expensive from Amazon again.  It's not worth the risk for such poor customer service.The average of five stars for the TV and zero stars for Amazon is 2.5 stars, but I rounded the overall score up to three stars because the TV is so good.
