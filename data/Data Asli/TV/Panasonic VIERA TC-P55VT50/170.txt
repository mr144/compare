Received on time, the delivery company has set it up as well.TV has beautiful picture. You need to plAy around with picture settings to dims out what is best for your viewing. I like it little warmer and sharper, So the original 'normal' picture did not do for me and I had to make some changes. You should know whAt you are doing, look at the other categories and see what you like and customize.Not quite figured out the round remote. Will update when I do.Overall it is a great TV for the money I paid for.I wish I would have bought one size bigger. That is my fault. Look at the guides before you decide but do not believe them blindly. I did but I see now thAt guidelines are too conservative.
