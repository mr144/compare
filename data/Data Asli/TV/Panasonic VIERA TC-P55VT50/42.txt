I spent a tremendous amount of time researching HDTVs to replace and old DLP Samsung... This one got the nod for all the reasons you see in other reviews even though I had misgivings. My own experience with Panasonic products have been underwhelming to say the least.For the 5 days that I actually got to use the product, I must admit that I was happy with the purchase. Aesthetically it is good looking TV and the picture is unparalleled. I have no significant complaints outside of the fact that it died 5 days after it was delivered to me. It made some kind of popping sound - then the screen turned into a sort of bad LSD-induced rainbow dream world. I turned it off... and it has yet to return - a steady power light but no picture... nothing...The warranty call goes out tomorrow... I will update as my story continues, but I have the box in the garage and will have it primed for a return to amazon.>> UPDATE 2/6/2013Amazon's customer service is exemplary. They heard my case and are shipping a replacement TV due to arrive in 3 business days. No questions - not hassle.
