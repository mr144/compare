The picture is the best out there!  The sound is decent.  The 2011 and 2012 models have a manufacturing defect but it is under warranty.  They have to replace 18 screws in the back of the tv if you have a loud buzzing noise with white picture (and sound off- mute).  I do not know the part number but they will send you 18 screws with locking nuts to correct the issue.  It happens with other models I was told as well.  Other than this one issue in 5 months, it has been a great TV!
