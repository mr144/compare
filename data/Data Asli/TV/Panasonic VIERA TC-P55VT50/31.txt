VT50 arrived from Amazon in perfect condition. Driver delivered it to my media room, unboxed it and demonstrated proper function. I dialed in a custom picture setting using calibration settings I found online, then tweaked to my preference. THX picture options are very good too, right out of the box. I will have a professional calibration performed when a reasonable break-in period has passed, because this set is capable of producing the best picture currently available. Bluetooth audio to a pair of headphones is a great feature for late-night viewing while others are asleep. Highly recommended!
