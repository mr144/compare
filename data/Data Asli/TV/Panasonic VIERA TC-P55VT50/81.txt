I must have spend months looking at a variety of LED - Plasma TV's out there.  Like very on else, size of room was considered, color, speed, etc.  I can tell you that I almost bought another model (for more money) but when I went into the store this set (sitting side by side) was so much nicer for less money.  Face it, you want a good set, a very reliable one, and something that will last.  Price was a consideration, for me I am not rich.  I love to watch football, so size (65 inch or more) was a strong consideration for me.  My room was large enough, and add the ability to slip in a video card and watch home movies was a plus.  Do not let the idea of thinking a plasma is old fashion or on the way out the door.  Frankly they are coming back strong because they produce a better (more vivid color) picture - and they have solved the issues related to the early models of the 90's (with pixilization).  New Plasma's are out performing LCD's and LED's.  I have used the 3D a few times, love it.  I have connected with my computer and it is a dream.  I have had mine now for over a year, and I believe I made the best decision regarding buying a new larger set for my man cave.  I did recommend this to anyone......  Ca not go wrong with this set.
