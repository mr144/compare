I purchased this tv to get the most accurate picture available on a sub $2000 55 inch tv. I researched quite a bit and performed field testing in local stores with mostly Panasonic and Samsung both Plasma and LED tv's. I am confident that I achieved my goal.The picture is shockingly clear, colors are extremely accurate with the best black levels that I have ever seen. I am not exaggerating when I say that in a dark room you can not distinguish black on the screen from the piano black bezel.The THX bright room setting provide a picture that is more than bright enough during the day with the sun shining through 2 large windows in my living room. The THX Cinema setting is perfect when the lights are off watching a late night blue ray.If I had to criticize anything about this tv it would be the Smart features. The interface is a little less polished than the Samsung and the apps are a lacking. I also think the aluminum trimmed bezel is slightly tacky.I would strongly recommend this tv anyone who places picture quality above all else.
