I sold my pioneer 60' pro141fd plasma tv as I was concerned about service if ever needed as its been discontinued for 3years . I still  think it was the best plasma by a hair , but than again this set is also great in other ways . It's larger, 3d, and the blacks are very close to the Kuro . I feel it is the best currant set out there. You will need to tweak the color etc  to get the best  out of it.at first it was very dark but about 20 minutes later it was better than great, and I am sure it will break in to even be better. By the way I must also give very high marks to pilot delivery service. These guys were great ..
