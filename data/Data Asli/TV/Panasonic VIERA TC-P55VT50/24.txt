I chose this TV based on all the 3rd party ratings...and believe me, I did my homework on this purchase. They were right.  It's a great TV.  Amazing colors and clarity.  Packaging was great and protected the TV during shipping/handling.  Only 2 issues to mention is the &#34;advertisements&#34; on the bottom on the screen when the TV boots up.  They disappear quickly but I do not want them there at all.  Probably a setting I can change to get rid of them??  Also, the TV does not swivel on the stand.  Both are very minor.Again, if you are considering purchasing this TV...just do it.  You'll love it. This TV is the best. This TV is the best. This TV is the best. This TV is the best. This TV is the best. This TV is the best. This TV is the best.
