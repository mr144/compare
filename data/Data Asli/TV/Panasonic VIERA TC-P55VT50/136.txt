This was my first go at buying a plasma TV.  I spent a lot of time researching 55' TV's and I kept going between this, a Samsung LED and a Sony LED.After installing the Panasonic V50 plasma the first thing I noticed was how much thicker the TV and frame were compared to the Samsung UN55 LED I had before.  I understanding styling should not play that much of a factor with the TV compared to performance but it does.  Anyways, I'll keep this short and sweet with a pros and cons list.ProsFantastic picture quality (at night)Very natural colors (this is something I am sure certain people love but most people kept asking me why the colors seemed so dull)Cool feature that allows you to flick content from your phone to the TV  (more gimmicky but still neat)Deep blacks, some of the best I have ever seenConsScreen is too reflective (I had an idea this might be an issue but I heard the reflectivity had been improved for plasmas)TV is not that bright, even when used on THX bright room mode  (while the TV did get brighter the colors were a little washed out but still do not compare to an LED TV)Styling (while it is great for a plasma, it just can not beat the thin, picture-like frame of a Samsung)Gets really hotDesign of the AC power plug prevents it from being installed close to the wall so it sticks out a good inch+.Do not get me wrong, I understand my main problem is with how my living room is setup and how the TV looks/performs in it.  If I had a living room without high ceilings or big north-facing windows behind my couch I did love this TV.
