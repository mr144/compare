I bought a 55' Plasma TV (Viera VT50 series) in April 2013 from Panasonic directly and it already has a burnt image on the top left thru right side of the screen. This is after standard/normal viewing for a couple of hours a day. No console games or any funky images. TV was NOT left ON overnight on any image. The burnt image is of digits/numbers (01423 etc..) so obviously it is a Panasonic manufacturing error. I bought the TV for over $2K. Called customer service and they said not covered under warranty ?? Do not buy Panasonic plasma TVs. The very fact they do not cover the burnt image under warranty, tells me it is a common problem with their TVs.
