Amazon was able to match what was an exceedingly low Best Buy price that I have yet to see again.  Even if I had not gotten a great deal, this TV would be worth the price.  While I know some would consider it a sin to leave it on the THX Bright Room setting rather than having it calibrated, my partner and I are blown away by the picture just as it is.  I will tell you that the base/stand are not the most solid thing, and that the set shakes if one walks heavily or runs past it.
