I bought this tv on June 7th, it has been delivered on the 19th by CEVA (that's the only complaint that I have) the delivery guys were very personable and polite, but regarding the tv this is stunning,with deep blacks. Right now I have it in burning process, in (custom setting) with the contrast at 50% for 100 hours.I had a VT30 last year and there is not comparison, this is much much fast in all aspects, and the app's are much better.Regarding the extra remote, it is very nice and helpful specially wit the apps, but lacks in Tv menu controls, for example you can not access to any Tv menu, looks like this remote has been designed just to play with the apps only.Just a small issue that I have, is that I need to turn on my sat box before turn on the Tv, because if not I do not get sound via HDMI, or if I turn on my sat box after the TV, I need to select another input and lather my sat box input, I will contact panasonic.
