I was unsure whether to get a Plasma or an LCD TV. The quality of this TV is great but very different than an LCD picture. Friends bought a high end LCD TV and after watching my TV and then viewing theirs I am happy with my choice but then again so are they. The plasma seems much more film like to me and the colors much more accurate. The picture on the LCD is much brighter but nothing looks natural. That said this TV is amoung the best of Plasma TVs. While less bright than an LCD it is plenty bight even in a brightly lit room during daytime viewing. I was concerned a plasma might be too dim and have too much glare because my TV room has 5 windows some of which are directly opposite the TV. This plasma has minimum glare from the windows and even on a bright day the TV is bright enough to provide a stunning picture. I could not imagine a room more challenging than mine for a plasma TV but this plasma is up to the challenge. The TV is loaded with excellent features, all the big streaming services like netflix, youtube, vudu,  etc. however unlike Samsung no HBO Go which I would welcome. Hopefully in the future they upgrade the firmware to include HBO Go. I love the Audio Return Channel HDMI feature which allows the TV to reverse feed the audio from content originating on the TV back to the home theater receiver over the same HDMI cable which the receiver feeds the TV. Both remotes are excellent although I have not used the touch pad much. I discovered I can use my smartphone as a remote which is very handy when viewing youtube. This TV is loaded with all the latest features and likely the BEST film like experience you are going to get in the home.  It even has the latest 1080p 24p for smoother film like reproduction. Buy it and enjoy it....I am.
