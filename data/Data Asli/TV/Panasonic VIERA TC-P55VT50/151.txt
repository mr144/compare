The Panasonic TC-P55VT50 has truly amazing picture quality, which to me is very important.  Though, one of the reasons I bought this product was to take advantage of its web browsing app, so I can view internet video without hooking up my computer to the unit. So when I visited a site (CBS.com) to watch a video, it would not load.  So I contacted Panasonic support, and they told me the unit was unable to do that, which to me seems rather strange since why else would you need a browser app if you cannot at least watch video content?  I do not see why it is necessary to just surf the web from a TV app (which is a little buggy) when one can easily do so on a laptop, tablet, phone, etc.Anyway, that is my only issue with this unit, so if you are looking for a television with excellent picture quality, then this is the best one on the market right now and at a reasonable price from Amazon.  Though do not expect much from the unit is browser app.
