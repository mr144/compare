It took me 3 Days to &#34; Get used to&#34; this TV.  Suddenly your eyes start to adjust to what natural colors and deep blacks that this TV shows you.  After having a top of the line LCD TV for 5-years, and watching my friends nearly 4,000 65&#34; Samsung LED you realize that all the time your eyes have been tricked.  LED TV's provide you with bright, loud, in your face images with contrast lines sharper than a knife.However, the first time you sit down and watch just broadcast TV you will notice black so deep and void of color it almost seems that they receed.  The second thing you will notice is that green trees, and forest scenes look bizarrely different in a good way.  Greens....you will experience all the true shades of Green as if this was your first TV.  I am beginning to discover magenta for the first time in the past two days as well.Current Set-up (1-8-13)VT50 (55&#34;) on a Crosley 60&#34; StandHDMI: Wireworld Ultraviolet 6 (1.4a @2.0m)DirectTVOppo BDP-93 Blu RayCambridge Audio Azur 340r - Receiver (not used currently)
