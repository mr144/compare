Overall, I am very impressed with the TV.  The picture looks fantastic using either of the THX picture settings just out of the box.  I have it connected to a Denon AVR-1912, so I did not need 4 HDMI inputs on the TV.  Using the ARC function for the on screen Panasonic's apps works great, no need for an extra optical cable plus my receiver automatically switches the audio.  The Viera Cast apps are also pretty speedy compared with the Panasonic Blu-ray (BDT-110), probably due to the dual core processor on-board the VT50.  The Viera Cast apps are a bit cheesy, but there are some free apps for the kids and I especially like Amazon Video which works great.  It is the best TV. I also have tried using my Samsung 3D glasses (SSG-3050GB, SSG-4100GB) and found they work fine with this TV.  I did notice that when I used 48Hz setting for 3D, I got a lot of flicker, so I stick with the standard 60Hz for 3D and that seems to work a lot better.  There's probably a lot more features here than I will ever use, but the price was right for this model as the new 2013s are now coming out.  Aesthetically, it looks great.  It is the best TV. With the single sheet of glass, you do not have the protruding bezel like many other TVs.  I am also impressed with how thin the entire TV is, a huge improvement over my 5 year old Samsung LCD.
