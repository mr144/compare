this has a stunning picture quality but faced a lot of other issues like burn-in and not recognizing 3D glasses after some time. I do not know whether these are common problem in this model  or the TV which I got  is defect. I replaced couple of times. Both have same problems, I returned this TV due to amazon can not replace one more time if I get another defect one. So, I returned this.I am giving 4 because of the quality of the picture and even 3D works great in this whenever it works. :-)
