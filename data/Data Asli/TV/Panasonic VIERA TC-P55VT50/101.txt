We purchased this TV in November , had it installed, and LOVE it!  It is a great TV. The picture is sharp and clear and the size is large but not at all overwhelming.My only beef is with the sneaky way that our order was apparently routed, by Amazon,  to some unknown 3rd party seller, causing us to lose the $500 promotional credit that was one of the main reasons we purchased through Amazon in the first place.  We selected the item 'Sold by and shipped by Amazon.com' (as required by the terms of the promotion), put it in our Amazon cart, and paid for it.  Upon delivery we noticed that the return address was an unknown dealer but did not think anything about it, since the ad had plainly said 'sold by and shipped by Amazon.com' when we purchased the item.  When trying to obtain our promised $500 credit, we were told that since we 'opted to purchase from a 3rd party seller' we did not qualify for it.  Since we never even SAW an option other than 'Sold by and shipped from Amazon.com', we obviously did not 'opt' to do any such thing (especially knowing that we would not qualify for the $500 credit if we did not purchase from Amazon).So, BEWARE!  When Amazon offers a deal, it is not always enough to read and re-read the fine print and follow the instructions.
