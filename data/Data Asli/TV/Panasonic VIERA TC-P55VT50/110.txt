The TV looks sleek in my living room. The colors are real and the black level looks good.I gave a 4 because I still am not sure if the HD picture quality in this TV is the best.HD pic in my sony KDL-W5100 seems to have better clarity. I did not compare any technical setting between the two but the Sony looked a tad better to my eyeballs (LCD vs Plasma?). I had expected this $2500 latest wonder to beat my older TV in pic quality. Have not tested the 3D pic yet. Overall I am satisfied.
