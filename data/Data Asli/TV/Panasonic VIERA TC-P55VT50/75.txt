I bought this TV from another vendor because Amazon did not have the best price. Sorry Amazon, I do like your selection, convenience, overall pricing and free shipping. It's everything I had expected but there's one thing that pisses me off; every time I turn the TV on I get a third party advertising banner at the bottom of the screen for about 5 seconds. The nerve of Panasonic and the vendors they are selling this advertising opportunity to is unfathomable. Shame on you Panasonic and please consider a firmware update that will turn this unreasonable feature off. As for the advertiser, I do notice and I will not purchase any of your goods and services as long as you insist on invading my privacy.
