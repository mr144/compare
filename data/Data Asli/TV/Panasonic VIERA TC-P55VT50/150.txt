Amazing picture and clarity from my TiVo & PS3.The THX picture settings are awesome right out of the box. Which was a relief, 'cause I just do not have time to calibrate like I have done for my previous HD sets.The CEVA delivery was excellent, too. Set happily arrived earlier than expected (they called to confirm that earlier was ok), and set-up/clean-up was quick and professional.Great experience all around.
