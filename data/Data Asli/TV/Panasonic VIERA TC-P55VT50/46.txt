It looks great and is easy to operate.  The picture can be a little hard to see in a bright room.The only complaint I have has nothing to do with the television itself.  The shipping company did not deliver the television when Amazon said it would arrive.  They did not bring it into the room and take it out of the box.  If this is important to you, please take note.  But on the flip side, the television arrived with no damage and I am very pleased.
