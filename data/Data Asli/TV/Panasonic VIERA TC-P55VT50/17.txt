Waited a year to pull the trigger. The price was equal to or less than for lower rated TVs. Read all the reviews. I have had it for a couple of weeks. The sound is pretty good. Its really, really good for HBO and bluray especially dark movies. If you do not have a good signal, probably not worth the extra money. From the the guy who paid twice as much for a Samsung DLP ten years ago. So far, for live sports, I think the DLP still has it beat, but it eats bulbs. I have to play around with the settings on the VT. Do regret not going bigger. The VT 55 with its small unseen beazel does not look any bigger than my 50&#34; DLP, so I could have gotten away with the 65&#34;.
