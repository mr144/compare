I did not bought the tv from amzon but I have bought it from a local dealer. It is a spectecular tv, getting better with every hour. Right now I am breaking the plasma so I am not going to calibrate it. I have just put it on Thx cinema and I am seeing a very good good picture.I spent months researching tvs, plasma vs led. At first I was going to buy the Samsung led es8000. But I hate clouding and bleedings while not having natural colours. On the other hand the Vt50 is more cheaper with perfect blacks (in the eveing you can not tell the difference between the frame and the blacks on the screen) and natural colours. The only drawback of the Vt50 is the image retention. I am not saying that this model suffer from image retention but I am scared from having it.If you are a movie alcaholic buy this tv and not led. Surely you will not be dissappointed.
