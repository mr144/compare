The Panasonic Vt-50 series plasma is this year's king of HDTV's according to the best reviewers out there. You can check out what the pro's say here. [...] and here [...]. According to my own eyes as well, I have to completely agree with them. I have owned a couple samsung DLP rear projections, a Toshiba DLP rear projection, a JVC LCOS rear projection and I currently own a Pioneer 50'' Kuro 5080 plasma and a Pioneer 60'' Kuro 6020 plasma. This Panasonic is the first tv I have seen out perform my Kuro's. Should be interesting to see the new 4K tv's and OLED's once they come out in 2013.
