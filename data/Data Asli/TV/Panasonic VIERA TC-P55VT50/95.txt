This tv is a great television.  I have the 30 in another room in the house.  Worlds different.  This one is actually close to my kuro.  Still not quite a kuro but very close......  I can not say enough about this tv.  Great contrast, fantastic black levels, color is great.  Calibration did make some difference but not as much as the 30.  This tv is pretty good right out of the box.  I can sit here and spout a lot of technical jargon but the bottom line is that this is an awesome television and well worth the price.  If you can control ambient light, do not even consider an LCD or LED.
