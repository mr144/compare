This TV provides an amazing viewing experience.  The first TV arrived with a cracked screen.  Amazon handled the situation extremely effectively and a replacement TV was delivered three working days later. The sharpness of the picture is amazing.  Movies and sports (well anything, really) really pop.  It was very easy to set up, though I am still exploring the different features.  I love it.  I highly recommend this TV.
