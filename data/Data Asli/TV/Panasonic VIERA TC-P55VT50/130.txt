I rated this 5-stars because I buy a TV for the quality of the image and possibly sound.  The image quality is astounding, I absolutely love it.  One of the best websites for reviewing TV's is avforums.com.  Their review [...] scores this as the  areference' quality on most axes against all other TVs this year which means it is essentially the best.  My experience has matched this, though admittedly I do not own 10 TV's to compare.  I also have not yet tried the 3D.The sound is pretty nice too, though I am no audiophile and I am sure having speakers surrounding your viewing area is a better experience.The area I am a bit disappointed is the software.  I did mostly like the software to allow me to stream netflix, youtube, and content from a local DLNA server.  I have the TV on Wireless N, but it takes about a minute after turning it on for it to detect and connect to Wireless.  Worst, you have to keep pressing  aretry' over and over again rather than selecting your application and having it wait while it tries to connect.  It's a poor user experience that hopefully will get improved with a later firmware upgrade.
