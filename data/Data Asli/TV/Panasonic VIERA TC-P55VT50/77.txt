I actually want to start with the delivery, because I was stressing out about stories of how delivery guys delivered defective TVs and then rushed the customer so that s/he would not see the damage before signing on the dotted line.  I took delivery yesterday from a CEVA delivery man.  While I was disappointed by the fact that CEVA only sent the one man, and I had to help him carry the TV inside, that was not a big deal.  Far more important to me was that he was ultra patient and friendly, giving me time to inspect the TV fully and check for damage, turn it on, and play with it for a couple of minutes.  What a relief.And oh what a TV.  I am aging the pixels now with the D-Nice slides over at HDJ, but have already watched an episode of Downton Abbey via Blu Ray no the THX setting.  OMG.  What a HUGE, BEAUTIFUL picture.  I am in nirvana.Thanks Panasonic; Thanks Amazon; Thanks CEVA.
