Would be a great TV but it is poor support of Dolby 5.1 audio is a killer. The unit will not pass 5.1 from an HDMI source to the Optical (or ARC) audio output. It's absolutely inexcusable and the response from Panasonic is that it is by design. There are lots of TVs that do this well - go for a different brand that handles this properly.Default mode displays an ad every time you start the TV (very visibly) which makes one really wonder what customer focus Panasonic has. This can be disabled but it makes you wonder what they were thinking???
