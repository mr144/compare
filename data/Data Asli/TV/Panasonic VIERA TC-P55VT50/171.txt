This is a very well made tv. I guess for the price you would think that was a no brainer but in some cases that's not always true. It handles everything you throw at it with phenomenal ease. The motion speed on this set is unreal and so is the details and black level. The size will lead some to believe it will ruin content such as standard definiton but that's not the case at all. Picture settings are great but standard might be a little to dark and dim for most people. Thx Cinema is a good choice starting off if you want a nice picture and also want to let your plasma settle in before utilizing it more vibrant and vivid levels. I am no expert on plasma's from a personal experience stand point but I do a lot of research and it was encouraged to give your plasma about 200 hours before using it to it is fullest. I really do not think it is required rather it is more of a safety precaution. I am not even sure if that applies to 'NEO Plasma's' at all. From what I saw it does not but I could be wrong.
