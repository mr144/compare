Let me first say that I think that this is an incredible TV.  The picture quality during the night is so amazing.  I mean I can not stop watching TV at night when the kids are asleep.  But, with that said, I wonder whether I made the right choice.Below are the things that annoy the hell out of me.  I wish I knew these before I made my purchase.1. The TV gets really hotI got the 65 inch and the heat output on this unit is extremely high.  The room in which the TV is located is not that big so the entire room get really hot after about 10 minutes.  So hot that you must open the windows or turn on the A/C.  I did not realize that the heat would be such a huge factor.2. Reflections are annoyingDuring the day, you can see a lot of reflections such as windows.  It gets annoying.Overall, I absolutely love the TV so I kept it at 5 stars.  The heat and reflection would bring it down to a 4.5.  So, it does not justify a full star deduction so, I kept it at 5 stars.
