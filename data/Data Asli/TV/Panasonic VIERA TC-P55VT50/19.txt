Had to have this TV replaced once and may need to have the replacement replaced. The original TV purchased had a very dull screen picture. Nowhere nearly as bright as my 7 yr old Panasonic Plasma TV. The replacement I received in Dec 2012 was better than the original but still not as bright as my 7 yr old set. My 7 yr old Panasonic has been running an average of 22 hrs per day since Feb 2006 and has a beautiful bright picture. This brand new VT50 expensive set is dull in comparison.
