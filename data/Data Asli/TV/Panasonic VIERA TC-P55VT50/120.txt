I have owned HD TVs since the original 600 pound version from Samsung over a decade ago.  I am always looking for bigger and better and, over the past few years, that meant going down the DLP road given the limitation in size for plasmas.  When my last 73' TV broke down, I went ahead and bought a 75' LCD TV from Samsung (http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN75ES9000-75-Inch-1080p-240Hz/dp/B0074FGZYO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1350608194&sr=8-1&keywords=samsung+75+inch+led+tv) and I hated it.  You can find my review there for more details.I finally broke down and ordered this TV even though it is much smaller and IT. IS. AWESOME.  The picture is crystal clear, the colors are vibrant and deep and it really does blow everything else out of the water.  I really wish there were 75' plasma options but there is no denying the superior picture on this TV.I also want to highly recommend Buy Squad, from whom I ordered this TV.  I had some issues and they went above and beyond and ensured that I was more than satisfied.  If you are leery about ordering a TV through Amazon, as I was, then use Buy Squad - they are much better than any local store.
