I purchased this TV a couple of week BEFORE Thanksgiving/Black Friday 2012 on sale for $599.  At this time is was sol/shipped by Amazon - now its 3rd parties. This is the 2011 model which retailed for $999.  It was highly rated in some magazines/sites listings as a product of the year or best buy for it is low price point in 2011.The TV works great, the picture is bright clear & the 120 MHz refresh rate keeps up with fast action sports even in 3D.  The more expensive 2012 model went to 240 MHz .  Maybe that helps with intense gaming but I am not a gamer.  The menus are easy to follow and setup is a breeze.  There is a large amount of ever expanding apps for the smart TV Wi-Fi usage.  The remote is very friendly with quick links buttons to Netflix, Amazon Prime and user defined options.  Flip it over and it is a full keyboard to enter information with.3D is stunning and easy to use.  ALTHOUGH frankly I thought that I would use it more.  My Comcast cable has 2 fulltime 3D stations & 3D shows on demand.  But it is nice to have.  Love the TV - NO complaints.BUT - the Amazon listing is misleading.  It states that this 47&#34; TV has a viewable area of 49.96&#34;.  Even some of the reviews boast that TV it is really a 50&#34; TV for the price of a 47&#34; TV.  That is just WRONG.  The Vizio website along with my own measurements confirm that the Viewable area is 46.96&#34; NOT 49.96&#34;.I complained to Amazon customer service after I received and installed the TV.  Their initial response was that I could return the TV and they would give me an additional credit of $50 to offset the cost of having the TV mounted.  I objected to the offer, kept the TV and was given a credit of $76 to compensate me for the 3&#34; size difference.  The said that they would take down the listing for the TV and correct it but never have.Even that this is a 2011 model IF I could get a good deal on it I might buy it again today.  I did have to compare what else is out there and the features on them.  I noticed that the price is much higher than the $599 I paid in Nov 2012 yet this is another year older.  I do not understand this - but compare it with other sites and models.  IF this is comparable to the best deal you can get I would recommend this because it is a GREAT TV.
