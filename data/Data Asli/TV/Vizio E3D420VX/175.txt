The picture quality of this TV is incredible, but the sound is just nearly unbearable!  My husband does not hear well so he turns it up and the sound quality is so tinny it excruciating.  We finally had to mute the tv and turn the surround sound on.  I disconnected the woofer so we did not have to turn it up to hear it over all the back ground noise and its much better.  The only catch is the surround sound gets out of sync with the satellite sound so lips are saying one thing and sound is saying something else.  We just turn it all off periodically to get things back in sync.  the 3d is great!  Just wish we could find more 3d availability on netflix.  so far all I can find is Imax stuff.We had a very difficult time getting satellite to work with the tv.  We finally had to put the black tape over the backlighting sensor and now the remote works fine, it took forever to figure that one out.  Wifi movie downloads work great with amazon and netflix.  Have not tried Hulu, it does not seem to have much in the way of up-to-date movies.  Have not tried using a browser.the picture quality is so good its nearly wierd.  It makes you feel as if you are on the set with people in a strange recording environment or something.  But the movies like spiderman and avengers is awesome viewing.
