Bought this for my living room -- its a great size, the picture is nice.  I really like the one-click buttons for NETFLIX + AMAZON PRIME VIDEO.  The keyboard on the back has never given me an issue (seems to be a complaint amongst some buyers).  It types just fine as long as I am pointing at the TV.  The sound is good.My only complaints:- I am having an awful time getting the lip-synch JUST RIGHT for Yamaha receiver it is connected to.  Probably not the TV's fault but no other TVs in my house have been so difficult to synchronize.- I wish the remote had an &#34;adjust picture size&#34; button like my old Samsung.  Its nice to be able to quickly adjust the ratio for stations with weird picture sizes.
