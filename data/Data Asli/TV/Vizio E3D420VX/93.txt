I got this TV for the bedroom, thought it would be nice to have since I am laid up for a bit.  Having the Wi-Fi and Apps is a really nice feature.  I already had Hulu and Netflix's subscriptions and have been using my laptop connected to the TV.  It is a lot nicer to not have to hook up the laptop.The 3-D is also a bonus, it works well for gaming and movies.  The picture quality is also good, I think it is better looking than my Samsung that I paid three times as much for.I can not stand the speakers on most TV's, but this one really is not to bad.  I am still thinking a speaker bar with a sub could improve it though.I have had a problem with it that is a little annoying.  When using the internet apps I have had it freeze up, when this happens I have to turn it off.  When I turn it back on the sound will not work, so I turn it off and back on again then it will work again.  If it was not for that little bug I would have given it five stars.
