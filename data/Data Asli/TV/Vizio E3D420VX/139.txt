We have owned Vizio before and have never had a problem with their product. I bought this tv for my kid because they can easily access Netflix for kids shows, and watch their 3D movies. This was also listed at an amazing price for a 1080p, 3D, and internet in one TV. The remote has easy access buttons so all they have to do is push Netflix.
