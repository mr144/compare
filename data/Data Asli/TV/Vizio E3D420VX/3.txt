I have had this tv for about seven months.Pros:*Great 3D*Good Refresh Rate*Good Picture QualityCons:*Backlight Bleeding*One dead pixelI play my ps3. Sometimes in 3D and watch Blu-Rays. It has a great picture and colors are vivid. The depth of the settings in this tv is amazing. I would have given it five stars, but the dead pixel and the 120hz refresh rate is just a up scaling of material in 60hz, rather then matching the supported refresh rate of the material being viewed, so it creates a input lag. (In games)Other then that. This tv is a great deal for the price. You can save up maybe another 100 or 200 bucks and get a LED Sony or Samsung that's better then this and provides better long term aging.
