I love VIZIO televizions.  I have two of this specific model and they are great.  However, one thing to consider with the &#34;smart&#34; TV's is that it may be cheaper and more function to buy a regular old &#34;dumb&#34; TV and buy a ROKU separately.  The ROKU provides way more options and features than most smart TV's.
