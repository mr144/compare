I can not find any issue on this TV. Friends and family do not believe me quality watching HD and 3D movies and what I paid compared to more expensive sets. The quality, the color is crisp, internet app excellent as I am also able to access crackle.com and watch movies for free.Question I ask myself, if I would need to buy another TV with these features, what would I purchase? Definitely this one! I am even thinking of replacing my bedroom TV with another Vizio E3D42VX.
