After approximately ten years of relatively problem-free viewing on my 42&#34; Panasonic plasma (SDTV, 480p), the lack of HDMI ports and true HD capability finally got the best of me and I bit the bullet to upgrade to a modern HDTV. Enter this Vizio and Amazon's amazing Prime shipping program. Received this television a full day ahead of schedule, actually even before it statused as &#34;Shipped.&#34; Set it up without an issue, and relegated the old Panny to the basement (P90X duty).The picture on this set is pretty solid, though definitely not as smooth as my old plasma. With Smooth Motion disabled, judder is prominent, and with Smooth Motion enabled, the picture takes on that weird &#34;soap opera&#34; effect. I have gotten used to it in time though.Do not really use the 3D much, but I do like that it uses the &#34;cheaper&#34; polarized glasses instead of the Active 3D ones. The internet apps (VIA) are cool, though I wish Spotify was available as a widget. And one time the Netflix app crashed and froze the tv, necessitating a power-plug pull and reset.Otherwise, very happy with this set, especially at this price point.
