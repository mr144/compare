great screengreat pricelimited online featuresonly alows for internet access via Yahoo service (microsoft would have beed sued over this)great remote with qwerty keyboardaccess to apps (we use netflix and crackle)some videos in netflix show skin color blue due to 3D signal from netflix conflicting with Visios chipset (have not found fix)This screen is 120 hz which means it flashes 120 per second as apposed to 60 times persecond...that makes the picture for old movies look unreal if you have seen that movies before at 60 hzgreat screen for gamming...which is what i use it for...comes with 3D glasses which i have not used and probably will not.
