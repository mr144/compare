I had needed a new TV and I did a lot of searching  for a great TV, that had it all, along with being dependable.  I do a lot of busines with Amazon, and they knew that I was looking for a good TV with 3D, 1080 x 1290 HD, and had WiFi.  They emailed me some of their choices, and when I saw the Vizio 32' I fell in Love!  I already have a 47&#34; Vizio for my living room, and I more than pleased with that TV!!  I needed another TV for the bedroom and when I saw what Amazon had, it was a dream come true.  This is definitely a a great TV and the 3D is spectacular!  I love this TV so much I went out and bought another one from Amazon for my office.  I have both my computers, and BD players hooked up to both computers! If you  are looking for a quality mid-sized TV, this is the ticket!  I especially love working and playing on the computer that is hooked up to the Vizio! Everyone who sees it wants one for their computer to!!
