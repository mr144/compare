This television has sharp crisp quality with rich blacks and bright whites. The 1080p mode is brilliant, super clear. You WILL need to adjust the picture options here, as they look kind of crappy out of the box. If you have a computer or game system hooked up, it does have a game mode. The sound out of the box is terrible, which is part of the reason it is only 4 stars, although, I am a major audiophile, not so much a videophile. I recommend getting a good set of stereo computer speakers, as it has 3.5mm out, in conjunction with the built in speakers. Thnis is what I do, and it sounds pretty good.The virtual surround sound is okay, i do not recommend using the SRS trusound mode.Pros:Game modesharp picture, albeit a bit difficult to set up just rightimmersive 3DCons:Subpar soundWhen viewing in 3D mode, you cannot use the Game Mode which reduces input lag. If you want to play a first person in shooter in 3D, this is not the TV for you. It is alright with Assassins Creed 3 though, as it is not nearly as fast paced as a ferst person shooter is as far as reaction time goes.
