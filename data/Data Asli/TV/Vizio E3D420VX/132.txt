This Vizio 3D TV works great, great picture and 3D viewing.  I current use it with satellite 3D channels and You-Tube 3D material using the internet app. The picture quality is outstanding in both 2D and 3D formats. I purchased a pair of 3D clip-on glasses that also work great with this TV. The one fault I found is it does not provide any 2D to 3D simulation for non-3D material.  But for the price, this is a excellent TV.  Highly recommended!
