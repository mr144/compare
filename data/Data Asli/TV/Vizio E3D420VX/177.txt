For all the capabilities that this TV has, it is listed at a bargain price. I did been looking for a new SmartTV with internet access for almost a year. No matter how many units or what kind, I always came back to the Vizio. I purchased it after Christmas and received it in 2 business days. The set-up and internet apps activation process was easy...under 5 mins. The picture is AMAZING! I was not sure that 42in would be big enough but it is actually perfect. I have not tried the 3D settings yet and the sound quality is good enough for me. I have a pair of speakers and a sub-woofer that I usually connect to my computer, and it works wonders on the TV as well.I really feel like I got a little more than my money's worth and I am loving every minute of it. Anyone who pays $500 and up for a SmartTV without these many options is a sucker. lolI also recommend buying the extended warranty. An extra $60 is nothing compared to what the TV should really be worth.
