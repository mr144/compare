I was so excited to find this tv because I watch a lot of Netflix and Amazon video. Sadly, it has been a disappointment from Day 1.My first tv broke within a week. Flat out would not turn on. Vizio replaced it, but the process was slow (had to call a few times to get it to go through, then they refused to fed ex me the new tv, but insisted that I fedex the old one back). Replacement tv works okay for watching cable, but the apps do not work correctly. Netflix only works about 30% of the time, and when it does not work, it freezes the whole tv and I have to remove the cord to restart it. The App interface is heinous--hard to find your apps, hard to organize in an easy way, and Amazon's app is impossible to use. The picture quality is good, but plenty of 32&#34; tvs have good picture quality. Wish I had bought another brand and a roku...
