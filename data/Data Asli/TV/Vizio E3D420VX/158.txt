after buying the 32 inch 3d version and totally loving it I took a serious look at the 47 inch for my new media room. I researched just about every brand of 42 to 50 inch 3d/smart tv out there. I really wanted the convenience of passive 3d glasses for obvious reasons. As I started narrowing my search it came down to LG or Vizio. For the money there was no LG option in the ballpark of the Vizio and since my 32 inch has been outstanding I figured I could not lose with its 47 inch big brother. This one comes with the qwerty keyboard on the back of the remote that was missing on the 32 inch model so that was a nice bonus. Setup and connecting it to my yamaha receiver was a breeze. 3d movies look awesome even from off center angles. We watched a wild life movie about elephants and orangutans and it was amazing. For $598 this is the best choice out there bar none. You will not be disappointed.  Good luck.UPDATE 5-15-13 (6 months later): Only had one issue with the TV so far.  The HDMI 1 port seems to have stopped working.  Since all my hdmi connections go through my Yamaha receiver, I only need one HDMI on the TV to work so I just switched to the HDMI 2 port and all is well.  Other than that it is been humming along without any issues. I would still recommend it highly!
