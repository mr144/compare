Recommended for anyone serious about 3D TV on a budget.  Easy setup (help available via phone, online), great 3D effect with circular polaroir glasses (in the box or from 3D movie theater), has 3 hdmi ports(from cable, from 3D Bluray player, from 3D camera).  Has apps for Netflix, etc.  What else could anyone want??
