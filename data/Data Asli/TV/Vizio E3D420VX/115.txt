So far so good.  I have had it for a week.  Everything works great.  I bought a blue ray 3d player and 3d hdmi connection to try some 3d movies.  It did not work streaming 3d movies though and I played with all the settings so I'll update my review when I get the player and new hdmi cable.  I'll lower my review if 3d does not work upon all my upgrades.  We'll see...
