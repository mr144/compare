I chose this rating because as of know, having owned the tv for 3 months, I have been very impressed with the picture quality. I do not like that the remote is not as responsive as it should be.  It takes a bit to start up 15 seconds or so.  I have used it to watch HD TV and regular programing and the contrast and detail is great for the price.  I have also used it to play ps3 games such as socom and assassins creed 3 both with 3d and the 3d looks good through the glasses and really draws you into the game. i would recommend this tv.
