Beautiful TV, with great 3d, and usable apps. But it is plagued with capacitor problems and shuts off after a variable amount of time, if it turns on at all. I have found some workarounds to get it to usually work for a while, but even after getting the power board replaced it started doing it again. I am going to think twice about Vizio in the future, my experience has been very frustrating.
