First purchase of a Vizio TV for me.  I am pleased with the functionality and picture quality to date (I installed this TV at the end of November 2012).  My only negative comment is with the quality or lack thereof regarding the packaging of the TV at Vizio.  This has nothing to do with Amazon, but the first time I ordered this TV, it was damaged & did not work.  The cardboard box face had a hole in it where something had punctured it & had broken the screen.  There is no foam protection on the screen side of the box, so perhaps it was damaged at the warehouse or while being shipped.  Amazon was cooperative and quickly sent another unit as soon as I packed up the original one & shipped as a return.
