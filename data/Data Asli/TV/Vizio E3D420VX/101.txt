These flat screen TVs come in a wide range of sizes with varying features.  I chose VIZEO because it got a high Consumers Reports rating.  The 42 incher was the smallest size (I have it in a small den) with 'smart TV' features.  I have not begun to explore them all.  One pleased me:  I was able to get a wi-fi signal from my computer in the adjoining room to download an Amazon Prime free movie.  As one new to in home wi-fi and movies without putting in a DVD, I am a happy camper.
