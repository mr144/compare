I bought a Vizio TV about 3 years ago.  About a year ago, they changed the VIA apps, forcing some apps (which I do not use) to be docked on the app bar.  Tech Support explained that this was done because newer TVs worked differently, and those apps had to be there in order to make them work right.  They refused to do anything to correct the problem.So long-time customers with older TVs are not considered worth supporting by Vizio.
