Bought this Vizio E3D47OVX LCD TV about a month ago after a decade use of my big screen tv had run it is course.I was disappointed at being misinformed about being able to watch any 2D channel in 3D, and had to buy a 3D Vizio Blu-ray player Just so I could watch 3D movies...and where the hell is ESPN 3D anyways?  All the hype, and it is already becoming an expensive investment. Not looking good so far.So, let's spend another 75$, buy 3 movies in 3D and check this sucker out...WOW!!!Okay, this is cool...it is just like the 3D movies at the local theater down the street.  Any angle in my living room, and it is still a great 3D experience. The 3D glasses are same that they give out at the theater too.The Sound is fantastic, the picture is an eye-popping pleasure to watch, and everybody seems very happy with my choice.Good Daddy!!!So my wife has since discovered NETFLIX and Pandora...add kudos points for buying a smart T.V. too.
