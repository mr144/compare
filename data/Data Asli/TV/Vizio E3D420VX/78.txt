I bought this at a local store and tried it out as both a DirecTV monitor and as a computer monitor. I decided to return it for the following reasons. As a TV, the 3D picture was very nice but there simply is not much programming to watch on DirecTV. I thought the ESPN 3D channel would show all of the big games live but that was not the case. All you see are old games. Who wants to watch games when you already know who won? And the other 3D channel showed mostly documentary types of shows. There is absolutely nothing new in 3D programming. I had no idea there was really nothing new to watch - boo! Also, the picture did not turn on right away when you press the 'on' button. I think that is because the TV has to connect to the internet which creates a delay of up to 10 seconds - not good. And the remote control did not seem to respond correctly when changing volume levels. Too often it just refused to change the volume. So there were a few problems both with the TV and definitely with the paucity of 3D programming.As a computer monitor, it actually worked fairly well in 2D but I could not get the 3D to work right. I downloaded some software from NVIDIA and then pushed some buttons to get it to play 3D games but no luck. Also, I realized 32' is too big for a computer monitor - it was giving me a headache.If you are a gamer and/or 3D BluRay movie user, I imagine it would work very well and satisfy those needs and I think my PS3 could do the job. However, for regular TV watching in 3D there simply is not anything to watch. I have read newer TVs will all have 3D capability in a few years and you will not even need special glasses. I guess I'll wait for that....
