I had purchased this TV prior and had owned it only 6 months when my 2 yr. old grandson threw a wooden ball at it and shattered the screen.  I looked everywhere to find a replacement.  Wal-Mart no longer sells this TV, but it has the 3D, WiFi capabilities etc.  I did not want to give up something I already had or have to pay more to get it.  Amazon had what I wanted at the price I wanted.  It was here in three days.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a real nice product at an affordable price!
