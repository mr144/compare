I have had this TV for a little less than 3 years.  This past week my picture kept going in and out.  Its called the 'Vizio screen of death.' No, Im not kidding.  This apparently happens a lot with Vizios. I called a few TV repair places and they all knew what I was talking about and they told me its not worth fixing.  I loved this TV in the beginning but it did not last long and there are hundreds of other people out there with the same problem.  I suggest a samsung. Vizio seems like a great deal for the components and price but its not.  Dont make the same mistake I did.
