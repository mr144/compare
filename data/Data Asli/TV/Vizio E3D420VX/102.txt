I bought a Vizio 42in 3D LED TV(XVT3D424SV) at Sams Club in Memphis.  A little over a year, right after the warranty expired, I lost the picture on this TV.  I still get sound but no picture.  I called Vizio support...not sure why they received the JD Power award, and they would not help.  I took the TV to a local repair shop and the tech told me it was a faulty LCD panel and it would cost $1100 to replace.  After I called Vizio again to ask for help, they offered to sell me a refurbished replacement for $600.I would never consider any Vizio product, especially their TVs.
