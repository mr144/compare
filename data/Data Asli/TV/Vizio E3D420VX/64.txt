Well let me start by saying i was surprised to see so many 1 star reviews. I think companies have to many duds in circulation. I have had my tv for almost three years now and I LOVE it. its sleek, great picture wows me with every new movie I see. It has lasted and been great the whole time. I get compliments on it all the time and the 3D is superd to competitors. I own many Vizio products because of this TV and let the haters hate. My Vizio is the best tv I know and I will be buying a 55 inch soon. This tv is awesome. It out preformes any tvs and I am now a Vizio enthusiest due to this tv. BUY IT
