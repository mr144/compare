Everything about the TV is great. Everything as advertised is there.The only fault found was the remote that came with it (the back of the remote with the keyboard) does not always seem to keep up or respond on some of the menus. Although this could just be bad batteries that came with it (Have not tried new ones).Other then that perfect size and 3D is awesome when applied.
