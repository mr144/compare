This TV really is a great deal! I previously owned a regular Vizio 32' LCD TV and was very happy with it. I owned it for about 2 and a half years and surprisingly I paid less for this TV (last one was 400$).Now this TV is not equipped with the best 3D technology, however for the price you really can not complain because it does work rather well... 3D is rather easy to transition into (most things you are viewing, the TV will recognize and automatically turn over). The one thing I have found you have to go to the settings to switch to the 3D setting is when you are using a USB device, but even still, switching it this way is just a few buttons away.The LCD has a fairly good picture, I did say better than my old 32' which is why I decided to sell it when I purchased this TV. The applications are useful, especially Netflix. I do wish it had more options for applications, but nonetheless, it has a semi-large verity. They are easy to access to since the remote has an application button which brings up a window at the bottom of the screen that you can scroll through.One thing about this monitor that may bother some people that I have noticed is that it has a light that will project on your wall behind the monitor. It creates a little pattern, that I have honestly grown to like, and it is not too bright, but is noticeable. Another small flaw is that the sound on the monitor could be better, but for the price you should be able to pick up a cheap sound bar with the monitor to up the sound quality.This TV does operate well for its price range. It's a good option if your interested in 3D but do not want to pay a lot at first.. I doubt you'll be disappointed in your purchase if you try it out, however one thing I am sort of disappointed in is the lack of 3D content that is out there... The applications alone can make it worth it though because you could easily setup a Netflix and Hulu account and not even need cable anymore and save yourself a little money!
