I bought a refurbished model from Tiger Direct. Although the shipping speed leaves something to be desired, I was not disappointing when it finally got here! The picture and the 3D quality are just as good as the TV's 3 times the cost. Excellent all the way around. All the built in apps work as described, which is great for one touch access to Netflix. Although I just use more PS3, great option for those with nothing else hooked up. The TV connected instantly with my wireless, and there's no problems maintaining connectivity. The sound is not theater quality obviously, but is any TV? It works good enough for the bedroom.I have read a lot of complaints about the remote. I have no issues with it. It seems that people are now too lazy to actually point it at the TV since it is not Blutooth? Haha. Maybe they should put down the remote altogether and go outside or something. The buttons are easily pushed, the keyboard comes in handy when using the built in apps. No, it is not backlit, and maybe it is just me, but after using it for 5 minutes, you just kinda know where the buttons are. Backlighting would be helpful for the keyboard side, if I used it a lot.All in all, you are going to get a great TV that compares to models well more than twice the price. There's no way you'll find a 3D 47' at Best Buy even close to this. I highly recommend.
