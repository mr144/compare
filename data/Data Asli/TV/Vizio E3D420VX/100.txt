I purchased this TV several months ago and I was a bit worried at first that it was not going to be a good fit for my bedroom but I was proven wrong soon after. This television was a great choice for my bedroom. I love the feature of the Internet Apps. It connected to my WiFi easily and I have very little connection issues. My modem and router are on the second floor and this TV is on the third floor and the connection is very stable even there. The 3D works great even though the TV is 32 inches. The glasses provided are so comfortable. The only disappointment was the 32 inch model's remote does not have the qwerty keyboard on the back of it while the larger models do.
