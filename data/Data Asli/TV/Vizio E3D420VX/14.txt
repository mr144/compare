Wanted a tv for my bedroom and this fit the bill.It was the best value for a connected tv I could find. I use netflix, amazon Prime all the time. Because it is a connected tv, no additional accessories are required. Hit the Netflix or Amazon button on the remote and you are prompted to log in and start streaming.The one quirky thing- it takes a good 20 seconds to power on. I have never had that with any other tv before. As for the 3d- I did not purchase it for that reason SI I have never tried it.If you are purchasing for your living room or as your primary TV, I would recommend looking at a Samsung, followed by Panasonic and LG before Vizio.
