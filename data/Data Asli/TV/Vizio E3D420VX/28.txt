I bought this tv from a store that sells coustomer returns.The main reason people return lcd and led tv's is because they do not know how to properly adjust all settings to make a lously picture look awsum.When i got the tv home and set up a dvd player the picture looked like crap.I went into the settings and turned off noise reduction,color enhancer,advanced adaptive luma,enhanced contrast ratio,real cinema also off.Smooth motion on low.Film mode auto.Then i go into the picture settings and set picture mode to vivid.backlight:42.Brightness:52.Contrast:75.Color:83Tint:0.Sharpness:0Then comes temp. sub menue.Temp. normal.Red grain 117.Green grain153.blue grain 147.Red offset 124.green offset126.blue offset 123.You must leave the picture mode on vivid.If you put the mode to movie mode or another mode you have to adjust the settings all over again.Each picture mode has default settings that must be changed and set by you.I now put in a bluray movie called speed racer which has the most amazing picture of any movie ever put on dvd.I started the movie and broke down and cried because i had a picture that looked it came from the heavens with no defects or artifects ect.sad thing is that the majority of people take the tv out of the box turn it on and return it for a refund.I go all around san diego and professionally set up tv's that someone was going to send back for a refund and never buy that brand again.When i am finished The people are amazed at what i did.Please keep this in mind before you give a tv a bad review and send it back.Do your home-work.This is the most awsum tv on the market.Vizio is awsum.
