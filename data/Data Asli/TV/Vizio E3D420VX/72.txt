Wow.Where do I start.Picture: What can I equate this with? Have you ever seen a soap opera? Do you remember how life likethe picture looked. Thats what this picture looks like with STANDARD DEFINITION not HD BUT STANDARD DEFINITION. Do you remember the TV show &#34;The Rifleman&#34;. i was watchin it when I first got the TV. It has never looked this great. Keep in mind this TV show is over 40 yrs old!When you switch to an HD channel, the subject better have a clear complextion because you will see every blemish, crack and crater on their face.3D-This is so hot. TV has never looked better!. 3D plus 7.1 surround sound!!! Need I say more. Now I am waiting for my 3D Blu Ray to get here and my system will be copmplete. One thing, if you have an older surround sound set (like me) you will need an optical cable (SPDIF). They run about $10-15 bucks.Sound: With many flat screens, the sound sucks. It is so tinny, you need to get a sound bar. Not here! The sound is awesome too. It even has an equalizer or you can choose different sound fields.Wi Fi-Connection is a breeze. It scans for available wifi. You pick yours, enter your password and Voila! you are in. Loads of apps too! Vudu, Amazon (da bomb!), hulu, you tube, netfilix, pandora and others.Price: All this for $500 bucks??? Are you kidding me???I said it before and I'l say it again...love it, love it, love it!
