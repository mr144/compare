Very easy to setup, had no real issues with the remote like some have said, did have two occassions when remote failed to control anything on the tv and had to power down and back up with power switch on tv but no trouble since. I am only aware of it updating one time(same day as initial setup), so if it has updated since then it must have done it on it is own time in the background. Had a neighbor come over with their bluray player and  1.4 hdmi cable and we all watched &#34;Ice Age 4: Continental Drift&#34; in 3D and it was awesome. If it lasts 6-10 yrs., I'll be more than happy with this unit. Have used Netflix but have not really tried any other of the apps.
