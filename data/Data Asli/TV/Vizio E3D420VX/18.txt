I was worried about spending money on a cheaper tv since they are often plagued with audio and video quality issues and tend to fail after a short time.Not this bad boy. It's a decent size has great sound (unless you are an audiophile and just have to have full spectrum sound) and is a smart TV.If you (like me) do not really follow consumer electronics all that much a smart tv allows you to connect to your home wireless network and watch Hulu, Amazon instant, YouTube, Netflix and more. I used to be an engineer so am hard to impress but I think this technology is just amazing. Think of a movie? Download and watch it.You can also connect an Apple TV box to it (provided it is not one of the ones with technical issues Apple will not fix) and enjoy all your Apple content.I found the remote to be excellent as well and although the setup took a while it was easy to understand. My only complaint is that entering network names and passwords and other credentials takes longer because the remote does not have an alphabetic keyboard, but who would want that after it is setup?Lot of fun knobs to twist to adjust your video size, colors and audio, etc. as you would generally expect.Great box, good price. Perfect value for the money. Get it!
