I would have put it at 5 stars, but today after only 18 days of use - the picture has disappeared.  I called VIZIO service dept. and they are ordering parts to be replaced.  I have to wait about 5 business days - we shall see.The first 18 days were wonderful - the picture is gorgeous, crisp and clear.  Watching Amazon videos is easy.  3D looks very good.For the price, I am very happy - hopefully will continue very happy after it gets serviced.UPDATE:  I do not know what the problem was, but today the TV works just fine with no service required.  I changed to 5 stars.  I do LOVE IT!
