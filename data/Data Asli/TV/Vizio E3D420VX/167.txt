So this was a xmas 2012 gift for my son. A new tv, not refurb. Great price, and all the features for a dorm room TV. My son took it to college after the holiday break. Less than 10hrs use and it no longer works. I read about a -pop of death- on Vizio TVs (capacitors blowing....google it).  Vizio was contacted and they are sending a Vizio technician to take a look this week.  I will write another review pending the outcome of the Vizio tech call.EDIT: So we called Vizio Support and went to an automated system.  They were to contact us within 3 days and send a technician. That call never came. So we have RMA did it back to Amazon.  What a shame. The specifications (3D, built-in wireless, Netflix, Amazon VOD, and DLNA) of this TV made it the perfect TV. Too bad it does not work.
