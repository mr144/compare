I got it at a really inexpensive price compared to the contemporary prices in the market for 3D TVs. I set it up in minutes, the back of the controller is actually a keyboard which I though was really awesome and sped up the process of set up. Has a good volume sound and on the seller I would have to say he delivered with god-speed.  He also had it set up to sign of receiving which I though was really cool considering I did not ask for that and I was being a little worried about receiving the item and me not being around. Recommend the TV and seller as well, A++ all around!
