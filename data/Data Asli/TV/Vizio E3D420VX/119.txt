This is the second Vizio t.v. I own and it is great.  I have it hooked up with cable and it searches and finds stations I did not know I had, running them in HD.  Connecting to a wireless internet is seamless and that feature works well with the apps.  The colors are bright and the sound is fine for t.v. speakers.  There are lots of options to personalize picture quality, sound, and internet apps.  I do not have large rooms in my house so this size works fine for me.  For larger rooms you did want a larger screen size.Set was easy and relatively intuitive.  However having the manual handy is always a plus when installing anything for the first time.I do not use the 3D feature so I can not comment on that.  For me 3D was a feature that just came with the deal.  I was looking for internet connection and HD quality.You can connect your computer through the t.v. which is a fun feature allowing you to look at pictures, downloaded videos, or just make that your mega monitor.I did definitely recommend this t.v. for someone who was looking for good value with good quality and a size that does not overwhelm.
