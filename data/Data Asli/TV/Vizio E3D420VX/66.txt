I just received this and set it up.  One thing about this TV I did not catch at first was that even though it interfaces with the internet, you only get apps that require you to pay for the service. Like netfliks.  What a drag.  The quality seems OK although time will tell if it lasts as long as the sony it replaced.  Bought that one in 89 and only had to add the digital DVD when they changed the TV airwaves from analog to digital.
