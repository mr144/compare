Six months of enjoying this incredible TV qualifies me as an expert on inexpensive 3d/blu ray technology. I patiently waited for twelve years watching my, now 20 yr. old Sony XBR 32 inch cathode ray tube TV, until technology/reasonable price($515.58 DELIVERED), caught up to my criteria for purchasing home entertainment.The picture detail and color is fantastic for all types of DVD's, but especially brings to life my older 420p discs. The speakers are more than adequate, but who buys this technology without hooking it up to a home stereo sound system which, again, elevates the viewing experience to life-like, in your room audio?The wireless pick-up is flawless with my older Belkin router. The remote is adequate with the understanding that you must wait for your smart 3d DVD player to finish its function-command before using it. This impatience is the cause of most cases of remote complaints in my opinion. I am very happy with my Sony BDP S590 3d blue-ray Player which takes over the TV when activated and is also wireless.Overall, this is my best major electronic appliance purchase of the last 20 years.
