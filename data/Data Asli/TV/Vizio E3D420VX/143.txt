There are only two relatively minor reasons I did not give this a Five Star rating.One it is slow to start up.Two the High Definition picture although clear does not come off natural. I will play with settings more but that's my initial impression. I understand that LED and Plasma can be expected to be better in many cases and that may be what I am experiencing. (We also have a Vizio 42 inch Plasma High Def unit)Overall a very nice unit
