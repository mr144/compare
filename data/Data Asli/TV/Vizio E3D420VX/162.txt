This thing is wonderful. The 3D effect is great, but as with any 3D, you have to take breaks. My eyes get tired after extensive viewing. My only complaint would be the lack of a 2D to 3D conversion feature. I have used a tv that had this feature, and it wad really neat to turn my favorite tv shows into 3D. If you can overlook this tiny exclusion, buy this. you will not regret it.
