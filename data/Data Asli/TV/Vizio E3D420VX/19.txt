So far a love this TV.  Great picture.  Setup was easy.  The internet apps are easy to use.  Wireless setup was a snap.  I am Amazon prime member and had the tv connected and watching streaming videos within a few minutes.  Videos were HD and I could not tell the difference from watching a DVD.  I do not have cable hooked up to this TV and I am just using via the wireless connection.  Works great.The help though does not match the actual steps available on the TV.  The book and interactive help do match the updated apps.  For example the help says there should be an app called widget gallery to let you manage the widgets on the screen but it looks like that was replaced by Yahoo connected TV store.  I did not find that obvious and assume it is a result of an update.  The apps all updated immediately upon connecting the wireless.Unfortunately though the Amazon internet app is clunky.  There is no way to search the Amazon Prime streaming videos and you just have to keep paging through them until you find something you like.  Amazon has the watch list now that you can add movies to so that you can find them easier but that function is not on the internet app on the TV (or on my blu-ray).  This is not really a problem with the TV but with the Amazon internet app.
