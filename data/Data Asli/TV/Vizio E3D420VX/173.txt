After looking over numerous reviews, I decided to give this TV a shot.  So far I am very happy with it.  I am not really into the 3D experience (gives my wife a heahache) but because I have a 3D Blueray player I decided to get one in case in the future I decided I wanted to try it out.  For the most part, I bought this model because of the 200,000 to 1 pixels and one 120 hz refresh rate.Setup was fast.  The TV came on instantly, and the installation procedure was clear.  I was amazed how quickly it detected our network, even though I disabled the feature because I use my wireless Blueray player through my receiver so I can have sorround sound, whether it is Netflix or a movie.  Boot-up did not seem painfully slow, as some have reported, and I have not noticed any more than a normal amount of glare, as some have reported.  In fact, the TV I just replaced, a 57 inch Mitsubishi, had more glare in comparison.A note of caution: when I first installed the base, the TV wobbled too much, and I discovered that I had not tightened the thumbscrew enough.  You want to make sure it does not turn at all.  Do not overtighten, of course.  But there should not be any give.One default setting I did not like was the dimness of the screen.  The TV's menu, however, is easy to navigate, and you have complete control over every aspect of the image.  For my tastes, I found changing the setting to &#34;footbal&#34; (even though I am not a football fan) over &#34;standard&#34; gave me the brightness and contrast I was looking for.We watched Men in Black for our first BlueRay, and I could not believe how vivid and crisp everythign on the screen was.  It felt as though Will Smith was in the room with us.  My last TV is five years old, and the technology has obviously evolved.So far I am very happy with my purchase.  It seems like a well designed product for a reasonable price.  If anything changes, I will certainly update this review and let you know.
