I bought a Vizio M series smart tv last month from Walmart.  On the first day I had streaming problems with Netflix and Hulu.  I called Vizio support and they walked me through a manual wifi set up.  Netflix got better, but Hulu still had problems.  So they sent out a serviceman who replaced the entire internet board.  It did not work.  So I returned it to Walmart and decided to order another one from Amazon.  I got this model which is also a smart tv and 3D also.  I saved over $100 by ordering from Amazon and I have had no problem with this set.  Love the picture and clarity.  Next time I need electronics, I will order from Amazon.
