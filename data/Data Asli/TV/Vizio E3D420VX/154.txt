Fantastic TV for the price ($500). Had it for 2 months now and no complaints. Love the Netflix compatibility as no longer have to plug the laptop in to watch series or movies. Very easy set up - had it out of the box and was watching a movie in under 20 minutes. Picture quality is excellent for this price point. considered a number of pricier models ($1000+) but this one is just as good as the ones we viewed in store at Best Buy, and half the price. This is our second VIZIO (first is not a SMART TV) however the first still works perfectly and is now 3+ years old. NO COMPLAINTS HERE!!
