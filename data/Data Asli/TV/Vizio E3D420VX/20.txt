I got this for my son since he is stationed elsewhere. His other TV broke so I wanted to find him a replacement and send it. It was on sale here and of course with the prime shipping, it made the most sense. Especially shipping to a base.I did get to see and experience the TV when I drove down the 1100 miles to visit. This is really a nice TV for the money. Decent picture and displays the Xbox games quite well.  I was not to fond on the 3D, but my son likes it even after a few months of using it.  We got lucky as for the most part, I nor he has seen any edge bleeding or flashlighting.  It also gets plenty bright.  The colors are not the best there is, but not bad for his use.I call this the good beater TV since it will need to move a few times and take a beating.
