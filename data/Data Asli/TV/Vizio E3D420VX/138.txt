The tv works fine - slow startup, slow response to buttons (channel-changing, etc.) - my biggest frustration is the TERRIBLE interface for using Amazon Prime Video. It can not be that hard to fix, but Vizio simply brushes off queries with promises to forward the suggestion to some other department. If Vizio can handle Netflix, Hulu, etc., surely it can develop a program to run Amazon Prime well.
