Love this TV and the versatility of features. Amazing remote control with keyboard which makes navigation fun, wish my other TVs had such control.  The image is surprisingly great with many many options to adjust picture.  3D works fine with nice sound.Not 5 stars because of the cheap construction material, but for the buck I got more than expected.
