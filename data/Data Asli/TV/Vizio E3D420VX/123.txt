I highly recommend this tv with its several hdmi ports, amazing picture and 3d.  I recommend everyone join Amazon Prime because besides the Prime movies and free shipping you get a low cost assurance and they will make sure they have the low price.  I paid $598, so check at various times because it goes up and down with the competitors cost. And free two day shipping come on.  Hell I have seen it as high as 800 and is at 779 now, so check from day to day or look for a lower price for them to match. I have a Hitachi 42, a Sony 42, a Samsung 32 and this VIZIO BY FAR HAS THE BEST PICTURE AND COLOR OF THEM ALL...I never thought I could afford 3D, when I did the product search I selected 4 hdmi ports because the sony i had just bought only had two, a converter box, blu ray, ps 3 just do not work let alone an atom based pc.....when I saw the 598 price only 80 bucks more than the Sony I joined the 3d world.  I enjoy it when i use the 3d it is amazing
