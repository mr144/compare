Do not buy Vizio TV's. I recently bought a Vizio TV. Looks nice  and everything but be aware screens crack easy and YOU can not replace them. They actually do not even sell the screens, they will make you go thru some repair shops that do not sell them either. If the screen cracks, you just throw a few hundred dollars to the trash because they can not be repaired because they send them to other countries to be assembled. So be aware!!!
