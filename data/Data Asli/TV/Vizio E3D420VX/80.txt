I do not have a lot of time to watch TV, but when I did, I would just watch it on my iPad 3.  I finally decided to make the switch to a flat screen after one of my friends made fun of my monster box TV (LOL).  I got an amazing deal since I bought it during the holiday season.  As soon as I turned the TV on, I could not believe what I had been missing all those years.  The picture is phenomenal, the audio is great (I hooked it up to my Sony Dream System or whatever it is called), and you can just imagine all the benefits that come with a Smart TV.  I got the Sony Blu-Ray 3D player to go with it, and I can not believe I can watch 3D movies in my room.  I could not be happier; it is perfect!!
