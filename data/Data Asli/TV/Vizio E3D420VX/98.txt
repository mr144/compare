This TV is a replacement for a LG 32 3D LED TV with voice synch issues. The sound if OK, the picture is barely OK. I have to admit that the LG picture was AWESOME!!!!!! This picture quality stinks for DVD. For HDTV broadcast it is lacking big time in picture quality. It has to be set to vivid for an alright picture. When viewing Blu-Ray and 3D content it is good, not great or awesome. Since there are few options for a 32' 3D t.v with passive 3D, I would say this tv will work. I am not happy with the quality of the picture after trying all the settings, it will have to do. If this tv was for my house I would send it back, but as it is on my boat I will live with the so so picture. I have 2 other VIZIO tv's on the boat, a 20' and a 22', this units falls well short of expectations. 3D content is good only if you sit directly in front of the screen, any off axis viewing is not watchable. I have had issues connecting to the World Wide Web, issues being NOT able too. No big deal as a majority of my viewing is DVD or Blu-Ray. I would recommend this tv for anyone looking for a good pictue. Good price but not so good quality. Hope this helps. The seller got the TV to me very fast and no complaints about that.
