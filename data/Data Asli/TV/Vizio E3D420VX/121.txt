Just plugged in my new TV yesterday...all I can say is wow.  I had read a few reviews from the technology web sites that gave this TV average to above average reviews so I was hesitant.  Their main complaint being the 2d picture quality, notably lack of deep blacks.  Then I came on here on saw a lot of great reviews on Amazon from regular users, so I decided to pull the trigger on this.  So glad I did!I actually got mine for $588, heck of a bargain.The screen is stunning...2d, 3d, whatever.  I am coming form a 42' plasma TV that has a pretty dang sharp picture (720p) and great blacks and contrasts.  This has just as good or better picture quality...well, in fact better because its 1080p with 120 refresh.  Contrasts, colors and black levels all seem supurb to me, and very customizable. Mind you, I am not a 'videophile' by any means.  Right out of the box the picture seemed a little dark to me, it was a snap to go into the settings and choose another picture mode...I scrolled thru them all and chose 'golf' as my favorite.  It was as easy as that...it is a bit brighter and vivid to me than 'standard'.Took me twenty minutes to get the thing unboxed, set up and completely connected.  I am a network administrator with 20 years of electronics experience though lol.Easy to use menus, easy to configure, easy to use remote...although I must add that sometimes the remote seems to be slow, or take more than one push of a button to get it to respond.  Will keep my eye on that.  Not the fastest boot-up time when powering on but that's not an issue for me.Already tested 3d with a movie off my PC and some short clips on YouTube...looks awesome, although like earlier reviews have noted, there is a somewhat limited viewing range for best results.All in all I feel that I made a wonderful purchase...I have no regrets whatsoever.  Highly reccomend!
