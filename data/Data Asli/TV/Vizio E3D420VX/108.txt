To begin with, the picture quality is exceptional.  Delivers a crisp, clear image in both hi-def and even in standard-def.  It does NOT convert your 2D into 3D, but the quality of the 3D when utilized is amazing.  (Just wish there was more 3D content available!)  The sound system  is satisfactory; my set is in the bedroom, and no additional audio sound systems are necessary.  All in all, terrific bang for the buck.  Would highly recommend this Vizio to anyone looking for a high quality HDTV with 3D capabilities.  The compact remote with a reverse-side qwerty keyboard is a delight to work with.
