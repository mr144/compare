This is my first 3d tv. I saw a video in 3d from youtube. All my family was very impressed. Too bad the 3D movies are still too overpriced. The packaging was great, and it was delivered in 4 days for free. The remote bottoms are too small. I love the keyboard on the back of the remote, typing is easy. A friend of mine got the same tv after I recommended it.
