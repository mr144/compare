This tv has a crisp clear picture, and I like just about everything about it. It downloads movies from the internet seamlessly even over wifi ( I have a good $100 router), and the 3d is very cool. I had to have the cable company come out and set up a new cable box and cable line from the wall. But after I finally got it working, I love it. The only problem was the shipping was very slow. I ordered it from Dell on Jan 11 and did not receive it until jan 23, 13 days!! Just be aware if you order from Dell the shipping arrival date they give you (which was supposed to be 7 days) is only when it arrives in your area. Then the company they use- Pilot calls you to make an appointment to deliver to your home, and their next available appointment might be a couple of days after that. It really took too long to ship especially considering it only went from Philadephia to north central New Jersey. I would give it 5 stars if it was not for the slow shipping.
