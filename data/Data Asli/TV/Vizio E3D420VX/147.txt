Great picture but unfortunately after six months of ownership Vizio has had to replace my television twice. All three televisions have had the same issue: the HDMI connections stop working. Any google search will admit that this is a common problem, however, Vizio will not. In fact while trying to discuss return options for the third television in one year, I was told that this issue is not a product of the television but a product of its environment. Needless to say, my customer service experience has been as unpleasant as my Vizio ownership. Last time I purchase any Vizio products.
