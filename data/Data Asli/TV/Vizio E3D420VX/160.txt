Great 3D tv and can use glasses from the movie theaters.3D looks just like the theaters with an attached Blue ray 3D DVD Player and Movies.Lots of HDMI connections for all my devices.Easy to setup and connect to the internet.Only small issue is that the remote has to be pointed flat to get the tv to respond to it.
