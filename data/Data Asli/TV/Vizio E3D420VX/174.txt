This TV is a bargain for folks like me who have put their faith in a future of digital media without the unreliable cd-based technology of the late 70s. Several USB ports (mov, avi, mp4, mkv, etc), Internet connectivity, and popular online media services such as Amazon Prime Instant and Netflix just work.The remote's interface with the software leaves something to be desired, however. Much of this is the fault of the service providers (Netflix's UI is usable; Amazon Prime's -- not so much), but ven when watching external media it is hard to guess what OK and Exit will do vs Play and Back, for example. And I can not tell you how frustrating it is to accidentally hit Stop instead of Pause and have the movie's progress reset to the beginning.
