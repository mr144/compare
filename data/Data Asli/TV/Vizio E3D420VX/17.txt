You are reading this because you want to know what I think of this TV so YOU can make a decision to purchase or you just like reading and you really need to get a life!Just as you, I read reviews in ADVANCE of purchasing this TV.  I even talked to a CUSTOMER REP at Vizio.  I specifically asked him if this 3D TV accepts .MPO (3D format images) for the USB connection on the TV.  This rep, WADE, told me 'YES it does.'  With his position at Vizio, he's suppose to be informative and relay this information to the potential customer.  So, I ordered this TV.  Upon setting up the TV, I inserted my USB thumb drive, with many .MPO images on it,  Seems those .MPO's do not show up.So, I called, AGAIN, to Vizio customer support telephone line.  Spoke to ZACK.  After a couple of minutes on hold (he must have actually done his 'homework' and looked up my question on his script for this model) he informed me .MPO is NOT possible as this TV does not support this format.Seems Vizio's customer support's left hand does not know what the right hand's doing!!!!!!!!!!!!So, for those who might be interested in viewing their personal 3D pictures from their twin lens camera or downloading .MPO's from the Interenet for viewing on a 3D TV, forget Vizio.  Vizio is  amissing the boat' for those who might want this feature like Panasonic, Samsung & LG already have  on their 3D TV's.Bottom line: buy another brand's 3D TV (for now....maybe, in the future, Vizio might have new, brilliant engineers and marketing people that will see the need for this feature that the other mfg's have already seen as a bonus which in turn gets customers to buy their products).**** Because of Vizio's poorly trained customer service rep, WADE, it is costing me a 15% restocking fee plus the cost to ship this TV back to the seller. ****My 2ï¿½
