Ok just a quick up date. I love this tv. So far no problems and I love the 3D. Awsome way to watch a movie. I cant wait until the new Oz comes out. I will have a house full. I had to order more 3D glasses. Do not be afraid to buy a 3D tv. Its really fun. Everything else is wonderful. It does take a few days to get used to the motion option this tv has, but you can turn it off. I like that it looks live. Anyway, no problems so far. Yes the remote is a pain in the butt and it takes a few seconds for the tv itself to turn on after you hit the power but I could care less. LOVE IT. I will be buying another Vizio for my home office soon and will keep an update on that aswell.
