I got a fantastic deal on this television through amazon. The picture is amazing. I have HD satellite and the picture is so clear and crisp I feel as if I could reach out and touch the characters on the screen. The internet apps that i use are the Netflix and the Amazon instant video. Both work well and the remote as quick start buttons for them. The sound leaves a lot to be desired but I think most big screens do. Xbox 360 games look fantastic on the screen. This is my second Vizio and I will be purchasing another for the office. Would recommend this television to anyone.
