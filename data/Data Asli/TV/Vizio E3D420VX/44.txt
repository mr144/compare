Purchased this 47 inch TV from amazon at a great price has all the latest technology,internet and includes 3D. I had a slight level of concern with delivery for such a large TV. The delivery was timely and the box had no (zero) marks, dents, or dings, it was perfect.Very simple quick set up guide. No stress setting it up at all.Highly recommended.Bill R (60 years old, low tech)Old Bridge, NJ
