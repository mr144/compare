The good news is Vizio Customer Service is based in the US, that is positive as I speak with them monthly. The bad news is below.Apps: The HULU and Netflix Apps do NOT work. Thhey hardly ever run at all, and when they do they have to buffer constantly. I have not watched a smooth TV show on wither service from this tv.WIFI: Joke.Amazon: They charge the least because they provide you with less of a warranty. Vizio normally has a warranty of 90 days for replacement without repair, if you buy through Amazon you get 30 days. This would have been useful to know as I am now on my 3rd television.3D Works fine....I tried to give this half a star but was not able. This TV sucks.
