I got this TV for christmas from my wish list, and it is awesome. You are not gonna find a 3d tv this size anywhere near this price. Let me explain why this TV is so awesome:-3d 1080p 120hz-Smart TV with built in apps: Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon instant video, Facebook, Twitter-2 usb ports, 3 hdmi-The remote is sweet, it has a full keyboard in the back for searching-passive 3d, inexpensive glassesAs far as 3d goes I use it on my ps3, it looks great. I do not notice lines like what is supposed to happen with passive 3d. Some games look better than others, and 3d resolution is lower than hd.What is not so great about the TV is:-the remote is not bluetooth so has to be pointed perfectly when using the keyboard (probably better for battery life)-the remote keyboard is not like a cell phone keyboard, you kinda have to press hard and there is no click responseOverall I am very happy with the TV, Vizio is a great brand.***Edit: I forgot to mention sound. It sounds clear and full when watching TV shows and movies. I do not think any TVs sound good, and this is one of the better sounding TVs I have heard. Although playing music, or rock band do not sound so great because there is not a lot of bass.
