The response time for the 47 inch is 8-10 ms not 5. This is a great TV for the price but the description is not accurate. It will take ALOT of adjustment to get the picture right. 3d is awesome.UPDATE: Tiger Direct is a horrible company that uses the bait and switch. I got a lesser model than the one I purchased. Also, The sound goes up and down for no reason. If you purchase this piece of crap buy the warranty and DO NOT buy from Tiger Direct. You WILL regret it.
