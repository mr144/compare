I did months of research before deciding on what TV to buy, thanks partly to all the great reviews people write here.I had a short list of TVs that fit my specs and then I waited for prices to drop as the holidays came nearer. They did not drop much so I decided to buy this one, that was reconditioned. The vendor had great reviews so I was not too worried. The TV did take the full allotted shipping time, and yet arrived in good condition the last day it was due. They also did a good job of packing the TV and reinforcing the outside corners of the box.Upon plugging it in and entering my modem code, we were wireless and up and running. The picture is enviable. Now my friends want to watch football at my house! The picture is clear, HD is HD and the picture is good from various angles, such as sitting on the floor looking up and up to 45 degrees off to one side or the other. I have an apartment, the living room is about 12 X 14, so not really big but this TV fits nicely and has a clean sleek look to it.I use an antenna to get local stations, and when I set the antenna in the right place the picture is awesome!The only complaint I have is that it seems slow to respond to the remote, turning on and off, and the Netflix app takes 20 seconds to show up after I press the Netflix button. Even from the app menu, the item selected is slow to respond. But over all, I do not surf much from different apps and the TV stations change fast enough with the remote.The sound is pretty good too, all I need in an apartment. When I get a bigger place, there will be a new buddy for this TV in the form of a 6 speaker surround system.
