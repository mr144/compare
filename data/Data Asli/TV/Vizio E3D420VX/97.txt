The TV has a great picture with excellent response time even with high motion shots.The 3D is great and fun to watch.I have been playing with the apps now, and I am blown away. Streaming Netflix, Amazon instant videos, and linking to my Youtube account. I am blown away. You can pair the TV with your phone or other device through the Youtube app on the TV then use your phone to control which videos are streamed to the TV. It's really amazing.TV has both wi-fi and ethernet. I have it hard-wired to the router. Excellent streaming in HD.All this functionality combined with a great picture make this TV an absolute home run. I can not say enough about it.
