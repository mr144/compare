This tv is perfect if you want a smaller 3d television. Just do not expect to sit it on a desk and use it as a 3d gaming monitor, you cannot sit far enough away at a desk to where your eyes will uncross. But at 6 feet the picture is AMAZING! Tuner works great, there are more than enough hookups and even a good audio out option that is not toslink!This is an exceptional tv.I did buy another one in a heartbeat.
