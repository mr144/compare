I replaced a 10 year old CRT type TV with this and I am very pleased.  It has a very nice picture and the sound is pretty good too (have considered a sound bar).  We have not had a 3D DVD to play yet but I am sure that will work fine as well.  As Consumer Reports says - if there's a TV in your size class offered in 3D but it because the picture is the best that there is to offer, even in 2D.
