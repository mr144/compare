I decided to upgrade from a 32 inch CRT to a larger LCD.  I like everything about the TV itself.  The picture and sound are very good.  The navigation software is very good also.  For the money, you can not find an equal, in my opinion.  The customer service is excellent.  I had a problem with my remote when I first got it home, and the cs rep spent an hour with me trying to get the remote to work.  It turned out the remote was bad and a new one fixed everything.
