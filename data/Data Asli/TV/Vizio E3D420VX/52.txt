I was just in the market for an HDTV.  3D was not something I was actively looking for.  When I found the deal for this model I was thrilled with the price but not expecting too much from the 3D.  It was an afterthought.I put in my Avengers 3D/Blu and was blown away!  I NEVER expected the quality this Vizio produces.  The 3D is clear with little, if any, ghosting at all.  I can not wait to get some more 3D Blus.  (And now that Doctor Who is broadcasting in 3D later this year...I am elated with my new &#34;afterthought&#34;.)
