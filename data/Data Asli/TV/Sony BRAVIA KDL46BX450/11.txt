This TV is amazing for this price. I was not interested in any bells and whistles. I needed a flat screen TV with 1 or more HDMI inputs that provides good picture and sound system. I am pleased with this TV. I bought it last month. Till now it is working nicely. Touch wood. I would definitely recommend this TV to a friend. KDL40EX640 is better than this TV.
