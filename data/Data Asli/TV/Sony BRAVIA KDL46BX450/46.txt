I bought one of these, 2 years and 9 months ago.  First, the remote failed, and after 2.5 years the screen failed for no apparent reason.  It went black, and colored vertical stripes - mostly red - appeared.  Called Sony, who offered to send a refurb for about the same as the current price new on Amazon.  As a lifelong owner of dozens of Sony products this was pretty disappointing.  Furthermore, on the web I found hundreds of testaments to the poor quality of Sony tvs made in the last 5 years, with disappointed customer after customer complaining how their screens failed, and that Sony refused to do anything about it.  I hate to say this about Sony as it seemed close to Apple in its reach for high quality.  Cost to replace screen: $2,100.00.  More than I paid ($1,400.00).
