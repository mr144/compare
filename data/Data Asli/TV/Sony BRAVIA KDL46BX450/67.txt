We bought this TV to replace our old Sharp Aquos, and were very pleasantly surprised.  The picture is crisp, the sound is fantastic, the setup was easy, and the TV just looks good.  My only complaint is that it only has a few connections, so by the time I hooked up the sattelite, the DVD player, and the Roku box, it was pretty much maxed out.  Also, it only has one set of the older, non-hdmi connections, so I could not connect both an older DVD player and our wii (which is several years old). While I like the ease of use of the hdmi and the picture quality, I am not ready to get rid of all my old devices just because they are not hdmi compatible.
