First, I have to say we were a little worried about ordering a TV online. I talked to somoene in the 'big products' (not the right phrase, exactly) department at Amazon who assured me the TV would arrive in perfect condition, and if not, returning a TV was as easy as returning a book.  So we ordered.  And the TV did arrive in perfect condition. So if any of you are worried about ordering such a large and expensive item, set your worries aside.As far as the TV goes, I cannot give you a technical review.  All I know is the picture is GREAT, it was easy to set up and it is intuitive to use.  We are not gamers and we do not have 6 different things to plug into it. We have a DVD player. That's it.  Movies look and sound great for our needs.
