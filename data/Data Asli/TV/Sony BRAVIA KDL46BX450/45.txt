I received this TV much faster than expected.  I took it out of the box, connected it to my cable box with an HDMI wire, and in a  few minutes the TV was all set to view.  The picture is amazing. It is sharp and clear.  The screen size is perfect for my apt. living room and the audio is also sharp and clear.  I looked at other TVs, but I was replacing a Sony 40 inch and the Sony Bravia just has a better picture.  It is fine for me, but if you want to hook up more than the cable box and a DVD this is not for you.  There are only 2 ports available.  If a clear and beautiful color picture is what you want, with audio to match, then this is a very good choice.The lack of more inputs is why I gave it 4 stars.  It really works for me like a 5 star.
