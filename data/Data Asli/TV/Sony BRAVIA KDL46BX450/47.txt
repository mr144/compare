Location: SONY Showroom, Yangon MyanmarPrice: $ 548.00Warranty: 1 year_______________________________________Picture Quality: Impressive (I personally customize my picture setting depending on the ambient light I commonly used for watching, but otherwise I simply put it to standard.)Sound Quality: Better than most LCD/LED tvs that I have looked at (Samsung, Panasonic, LG, Toshiba)Setup/adjustments: StraightforwardOnscreen Menu: Organized, SimpleInputs/outputs: Limited2 HDMI for this model I thought is ok but I would wish for it to carry an optical output as well.________________________________________Opinion: I asked someone in Bangkok what could be the possible reason for the limited connectivity of this TV model, The person gave me two reasons: 1) Lower down the cost of the TV (considering that this is entry level). 2) To make a marketing reason for SONY'S HDMI pass-through technology. I thought the 1st reason is passe but the 2nd one makes quite sense.________________________________________My set up: TV KDL40BX450 / Audio HT-CT350 (from Bangkok)/ Apple TV (I use VPN) / XBOX
