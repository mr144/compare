I really wanted to like this tv set. Shipping from Amzn was great, unfortunately my tv was defective because it had a thin red line on the top right that would never go away. The red line was not standing out, but if you paid attention you would have noticed it. Thanks to Amazon the return was easy. Going to look at another brand.
