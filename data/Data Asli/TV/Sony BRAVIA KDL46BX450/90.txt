This is my first LCD HDTV. Easy to setup, picture is crisp and clear. Sound effects could have been better though, but not a major concern. I got a 3-year warranty for this TV. This TV has two HDMI ports, one at the back and one at the side. I have been mostly using this TV with my ROKU player.I wanted to know the difference between KDL40BX420 and KDL40BX450. I went to the Sony store nearby and talked to the representative, he could not clearly tell the real difference between BX420 and BX450 except for the fact that one is 2011 and other is 2012 model.Overall, a good economic buy. Go for it.
