I have always had Sony Bravia, But when I moved to the US I decided to try other brands like JVC and I was very disappointed with it so I went back to Sony Bravia. Its a little more expensive but very much worth the cost! I will never go back to a different product again. The sound quality is the best I have heard and the picture quality is superb!!! I would recommend it anytime!
