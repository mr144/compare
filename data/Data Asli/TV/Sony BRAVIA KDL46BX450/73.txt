So I paid a little extra thinking this would be a great TV because it was a Sony and was a little disappointed with the TV. It really does not do anything special that most other tvs do. Just goes to show that a companies reputation can change. Would I buy it again Maybe. TV works fine but Im not floored about it. KDL40EX640 is better than this TV.
