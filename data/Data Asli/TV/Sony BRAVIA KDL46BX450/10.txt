I just got this Sony home and had it up in minutes. It is hard to believe that we can purchase an HDTV of this quality with the name Sony on it. I can only compare it with other HDTV's that I have owned so far. IT BLOWS THEM ALL AWAY. I bought a no name 32' HDTV about five years ago that set me back about 12 Ben Franklin's.Set Up was a breeze on the Sony. It has an intuitive menu that is well laid out. I have a 52' Sharp Aquos in the living room. This Sony seems to have a superior picture. The Sony has a vivid picture and that is all I really wanted. Sure there are HDTVs with better specs.... but when you get right down to it....its the PANEL THAT COUNTS. My research here ,and a few other sites, led me to understand that many other HDTV makers are putting sub-par panels but loading their sets up with specs. In my opinion... SEEING IS BELIEVING. I saw this set in a brick and mortar store and I was able to do a  SIDE BY SIDE comparison with other leading brands. The picture quality is what sold me. It is noticeably better than the other brands. So... for me it comes down to PICTURE QUALITY. I love specs just as much as the other guy... but in this particular instance... THE PICTURE QUALITY ROCKS on this set. I hope this will help others make an informed decision. I love reading the reviews here on Amazon. It has helped me make some great buying decisions in the past. Good luck to all in their search.
