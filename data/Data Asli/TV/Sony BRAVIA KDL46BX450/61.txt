I am a huge SONY fan and this TV does not disappoint. Crystal clear 1080P video, seamless integration with PS3 - can be controlled with the TV remote. Nice clean design, not the top quality plastics and overall finish, but for this price it is acceptable. Would recommend it to anyone, although I did get an extended warranty due to the reviews I saw here.
