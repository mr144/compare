I brought this TV in OCTOBER 2012, as on May 2013, I am still having problems with Sony.  They sent me three different sets and all were defective. The thing that really upset me most was a Sony representative stated that they were going to send me a new TV or equal replacement.  They required me to send in a receipt.  After they got the receipt, they did not honor their agreement.  They said,  that since I did not pay the full price for the set, I would have to pay for the difference.In reference to the TV that I received, here is what happened.  The first set had a white line on the screen that was running vertically on the left side.  The replacement TV did not work at all.  I had a repairman sent by Sony to look at it.  He said that it had a defective mother board and could not be fixed. It was replaced with a third model, which only worked for a day and crashed.I spoked to Sony Customer Relations, they are in the process of sending me the same or equal replacement.  However, I will have to pay an additional charge if thereplacement cost more than the original TV.Normally, Sony is a reputable company, however, my experience shows a different side of this company.  I purchased a Samsung 32 inch and have had no problems.  If i were you, I would not purchase any Sony audio visual products.  They do not live up to the high standard that I expect from Sony.  I hope this helps you in making a decision.  Everything I said is true, as God be my witness.
