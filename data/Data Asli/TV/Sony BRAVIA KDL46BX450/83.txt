We researched LCD TV's for months, and were please when this set was offered for under $500. Of all the TV's I have seen, only Samsung has a better picture, and only slightly better than the Sony, yet it runs at a 10-15% premium. As other buyer's have stated, this set only has 2 HDMI ports, which is a problem if you need to add gaming systems, etc. However, if you want outstanding picture quality, and mainly watch tv/ blu-ray, this set is more than adequate,and you will not beat the price.
