Not 5 stars because I JUST got the TV todayFirst, I did a TON of research about whether or not to get a 'smart' TV, since I use my xbox to connect to amazon instant video, online gaming, and netflix. personally i was wary about the connection speed of the smart apps, as i did read they were slower than using another device/component. Also i plan on using logitech revue or apple TV to make it more 'smart'sound - really awesome, should not need external speakers if you are not looking for home theatre. if you are, i can not help you as i have no idea what that entails.pictue - it is a normal TV, picture is good i may increase the brightnesssetup - so easy it is a joke. a child could put this together, including connecting it to xbox/searching for channelsshipping - I chose 2 day, it came in ONE DAY! and was in perfect conditionoverall - let's be serious, Sony ROCKS as a reliable brand and for $469 it is well worth the money for the size. it is an awesome TV if you are not looking to spend $800 as I can make it into a smart TV for simply another $100.
