Yes, there are places where the listing says 2 HDMI inputs, but near the top of the product description it says, 'Four HD inputs for a cable box, PS3 and more*, so it is easy to stop there without realizing that only two of the 4 HD inputs are HDMI inputs.There may be many who can get by with 2 HDMI inputs, but there are also those who need a minimum of three (cable box, DVD player, streaming media).  I have no qualms about tvs with only 2 HDMI inputs as long as potential buyers are clearly informed and appreciate what they are getting into.
