I have used this product for a full day and I am blow away from what it delivers. I bought this TV for heavy gaming (PS3 & PC), watching Dish Network Satellite channels, and Blu-ray movies. I have tested each of these criteria on the Sony KDL40BX450 and have seen amazing clarity. There are also lots of features that it has which add to your personal viewing experience (i.e. different aspect ratios, scene selects, equalizer, etc.). The BRAVIA Sync Functionality works great as well (provided you have a capable SONY device which supports the feature).Additional Information: I have set this up in a small to medium size room, so viewing distance is not a problem. I did recommend this model even if you are planning on installing it in the living room. Also, do not bother listening to another reviewer who stated that this is not a BRAVIA model. There is a big fat 'BRAVIA' label on the top left of the TV (not to mention it has BRAVIA Sync).To conclude, I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality LCD 40-incher with a great price.
