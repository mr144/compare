I have been a Sony user/buyer since the first Walkmans appeared. I still have my 1992 Sony rack system that has been moved countless times and been through hell. The 5 disc carousel still works great but the tape-deck finally gave-up a couple years ago. Sony really shines with this Bravia. I wanted one ever since I first set eyes on one in a Fred Meyer store in Oregon. I FINALLY was able to purchase the 40inch Bravia (Best Buy) and by then (2010) they had introduced the  amotion flow' technology which really enhances the viewing experience. I think I paid $800.00 that summer. Purchase a Sony Blu-Ray player at the same time you buy the Bravia, the absolute best 1080p flat-screen on the market!!  You will NEVER go back to 720p or regular DVD's again. The improvement is that good. It redefines the old HD and has an almost 3D effect with some animation blu-ray movies. The Bravia has many inputs/outputs for components, game systems, etc, and you will want to invest the extra 40 bucks for the HDMI cable. It saves a lot of time and helps if you have additional components to add like surround sound system (which I hooked up to that old 1992 5.1 surround/lol) Just buy it. You will be glad you did and I would not be writing this/wasting my time if I did not think that the Sony Bravia tops them all!!! Personally, I find the 40 inch a very nice size. One more neat thing about the Bravia, it does not have that cheap-glossy glass screen like those cheap Vizeo's. The screen is matte which reduces glare tremendously. I can not stand TV's and laptops with a shiny screen, what a drag.
