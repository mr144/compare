I bought this TV as a gift for my 93 year old mother.  I bought the TV from Amazon 2 weeks before her birthday through Amazon.  The TV was delivered 2 days later. Terrific service from Amazon as usual.  Ten days later, while my mom was out, I set up the TV in her home following the setup instructions. Upon completion, I plugged it in. The only thing that happened was that the on light came on. No picture, no sound. I read the instructions again to no avail. I called the Sony troublshooting number supplied by Sony. They ran me through a few procedures and determined that the TV was defective.  They informed me that they had to order a part and send a Sony Tech. to install it. Ten days later, the technician arrived and determined that he had the wrong part. He told me that he had to order another part and that I would have to contact Sony to set up another appointment.  Now the good part.  Since I had already removed and junked the old TV, my mother would have been without a TV for another 10 days.  Frustrated, I called Amazon about my problem. The Amazon customer service rep patiently listened to me and after I was done, she told me to just send it back. In fact, she did all the work setting up a pickup by UPS.  Next business day, UPS arrived put a shipping sticker on the repackaged TV and returned it to Amazon. No charge to me.  Approximately 5 days later my account was credited.
