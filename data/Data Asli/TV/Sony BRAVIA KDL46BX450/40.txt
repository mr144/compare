Wonderful Picture, makes our old vhs recorder videos look like good quality digital.Because we are not very conversant with inputs and outputs we did not have sufficent of either we have a Sony surround sound and DVD outfit which needed the old 3 RCA inputs also the VHS recorder had the old RAC inputs after much searching of the internet we found an adapter to convert 3 RCA to HDMI after much moving of the wires in and out in different ways we finally got a great picture from the VHS by using the component input, and from the DVD player and tuner by only using the video input to the converter to HDMIWe think this ought to be a common complaint that too much is expected of the average purchaser in terms of the lack of information provided on the box it is assumed that most people know more than they acctually do thank goodness for ehow which is how I finally managed to make it all work together. Oh yes it is short of outputs too because the accessories have not caught up with the TV.  I wanted a set of wireless head phones guess what, no RCA outputs or optical outputs
