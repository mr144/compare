Just got this TV today, upgrading from a 37' Samsung that's 5+ years old. Love the picture quality, 1080p looks great, 46' is quite large for a bedroom but that's not a knock against the TV. I have a sound bar so I do not use the built in speakers. 24p on the Matrix Blu-ray looks surprisingly different than on my previous television. There's a change in the movement of the actors, its subtle but present and combined with the increase in resolution really changes the watching experience. At full retail price I probably would not have bought it, I did not NEED to buy a new tv, but I got a great deal &lt;$400, and at that price its lovely.
