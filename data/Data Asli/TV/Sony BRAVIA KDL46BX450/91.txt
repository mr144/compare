As far as picture capability this TV is fairly loaded for its price range. Basically it succeeds in the most important function of a TV. The picture look great on it, but its viewing angle is fairly limited for a new HDTV. I would love to see more than two HDMIs, but I guess if you are running that many HD units to your TV you should probably upgrade to a better HDTV. The main reason why I think this unit is so affodable is because its thickness, at almost 4 inches deep it is quite large for a non-discount brand TV. All being said this is a great bargain for a Sony quality LCD.
