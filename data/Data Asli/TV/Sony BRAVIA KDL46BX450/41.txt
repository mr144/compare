Wow- I love my new TV. Except when it conked out today. Power just clicked off. Tried several different outlets and still the same. Will not turn on with remote or manually. Called SONY service. They will do an in home repair. But I also just bought the three year warranty just in case.....Trying to get through to the customer service agent that I was totally dissatisfied with the way SONY handles warranty repairs was impossible. To offer in-home service OR a factory reconditioned unit does not make sense. Why on earth would I take a factory re-certified unit to replace a brand new unit 5 weeks old? Companies like BOSE simply send you a new unit and have the customer return the broken unit in the same box. Last SONY I will buy for sure.The set looks great after the repair and the repair man was a delight. He explained no longer can a  customer bring a SONY under warranty to a local authorized repair company. They have to call SONY and navigate their difficult customer service menu then they have to wait 7 to 10 more days to hear about when the repair will take place.
