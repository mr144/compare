While I did not purchase this tv from Amazon, I feel there's really not too much info on this specific model out there on the web, so I am writing this review to clear a few things up. I got this tv from the Sony store for $424.99, and for the price I do not think I could have done any better. I see the Amazon store is currently asking for over $500 for this set. I think once your in that price range you should be looking for an LED tv rather than a plain LCD tv. But if your still interested in the tv here some things you should know:Its LCD, meaning it has a liquid crystal display with CCFLs (basically fluorescent lights)providing the backlight. The picture is great, though CCFL lighting is known for distorting blacks. It is most noticeable when you have the black bars on the top and bottom of a widescreen movie: they will appear to bleed some of the backlight through, making it almost look like a glowing sort of black. Nothing game breaking though, thats just the nature of the tv.Since its a Sony tv, hooking it up to a ps3 will make it auto-configure the resolution for you, which saves some time.There are no RCA outputs, but there is a 3.5mm headphone jack I use to connect external speakers.The edge around the tv is high gloss finish and can be distracting when there are lights on in the room.There are almost too many options to configure color, contrast, etc. and there are about a dozen presets you can choose from which makes it a little simpler.I have my tv wall mounted, and the power cord and hdmi cables run down the mid-right side of the tv instead of the center, which could interfere with any symmetry you had planned.Other than that, I can not find much to complain about. The picture is great, I use it as a computer screen and for my ps3. 40 inches seems to be the max size for pc gaming for me.
