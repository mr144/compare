I did a lot of research and between this and a 42 inches LG TV and a 40 inches Toshiba,  I decided to purchase this TV mainly because of having a very good experience with a Sony Bravia TV , I bought a 32 inches Sony Bravia KDL-32L4000 in 2008 and have used it since then and really love it. I have been using this TV now for a month and it is just as good, amazing picture, watching Bluray on it and playing PS3/360 and they all look great. The TV is not too heavy and looks slick. I would have liked an additional HDMI port but that's not a major issue. Sony products are high quality and last for a long time both my previous Bravia and PS3 have been in constant use since 2008 and they still work.  I would definitely recommend this TV, you will not find a better 40 inches HDTV for under $500
