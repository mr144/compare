The TV arrived on time.  After taking out the old tv and hooking up all the gear to the new one,  I tried to turn it on and nothing  happened.  I had to call Sony ,  and after talking to the fellow  he could not help me.  He put in a service order.  Our TV christmas present did not get repaired until the day after Christmas.  I wont be ordering anymore tv's on line.
