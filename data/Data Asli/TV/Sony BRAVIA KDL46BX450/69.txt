Our Sony Bravia is 4 years old and the LCD display is going out. We had a Sony technician come out to look at it, and he said this is a very common problem with the Bravias. We paid over $2000 for this tv 4 years ago and to fix it will cost $1600. We contacted Sony and they said there were not enough problems with our exact model number to warrant their doing anything, but they would sell us a refurbished one for $575 (which is how much they cost refurbished at Sears anyways.) I understand that mechanical problems happen, but if you sell a defective product you should have better customer support to remedy the problem. I have never had such bad customer service, and will not be surprised if Sony goes out of business in the next few years.
