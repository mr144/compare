It was not until I moved into an apartment did I realize that I needed an new TV.  Now that I have a job and can afford a newer TV I searched for the best deal and fell upon the Sony 40 inch flat screen.  I am in love with this TV.  It fits perfectly in my living room while I can still feel like I have a very clear picture.  I do not know a great deal about TV brands or exactly what is best, but I am very happy with my Sony TV.  I have never had any issues with it regarding glitches, spotting, or lines in the screen.  I am very happy to say that I really like this brand, and the price was just in my budget.  I enjoy coming home at night and relaxing to my favorite movie or TV show on my new TV.  It was not until I got older did I realize how much the picture matters to the quality of the viewing experience.  Today I can say that I feel like I am right there in the show as I watch my new Sony 40inch television.
