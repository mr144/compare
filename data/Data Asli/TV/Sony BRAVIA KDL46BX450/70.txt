I purchased this tv through a retail store which offers 90 returns. The tv failed at 95 days. I contacted Sony and they 1st offered to come out and fix it. Then they  decided it was  not economical for them to fix (without even seeing the tv). Long sorry short, they called me back and  my only option in the end was for them  to send me an old refurbished tv with an extended 1 year warranty ( total of 2 years).  I would expect that if I buy a tv that costs more than other brands the same size and with less features, that customer service would be better. Now I am getting a refurbished tv, probably much older than mine, an it is getting shipped UPS where it will probably get banged around.  Now i can see why Sony is struggling in the TV market. Avoid Sony!!
