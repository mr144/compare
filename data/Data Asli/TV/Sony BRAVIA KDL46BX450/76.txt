40 inch 1080p HD TV for under $500- great deal.  I was worried with it being 60Hz rather than 120Hz, but this turned out to be not a big deal.  Watched the Indy 500 a few weeks ago and the image quality was great- no noticeable blurring.  I was also worried about the inputs (both HDMI and AV) but I was able to hook up both my Directv receiver & X-box 360 without any issues.  Guess the only gripe is the screen is more reflective than the Vizio it replaced.  I can plainly see our can lights from our kitchen reflected in the screen when sitting head-on in the living room.  The frame around the TV is also very reflective- shiny black.  However given the value, a great purchase!
