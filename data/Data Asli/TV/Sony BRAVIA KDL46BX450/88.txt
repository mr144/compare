Let me start off by saying that I have only had this TV for a week; but I am in love.  The picture looks fantastic, HD looks amazing, and it is an extremely good looking and well put together TV.  I was nervous when I bought it that it would not have the component video capability (based on other reviews), but it turns out it does... as advertised on Amazon, and as shown in the pictures of the rear of the TV.
