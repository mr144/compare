Got it on sale through Amazon.  Shipping was fast, as usual.  The viewing angles are not exaggerated.  It has exceptional viewing angles, but the only gripe is that it is 60Hertz, not 120Hertz.  From the looks of it, since I like to research even after buying a product, the market is going to be flooded with superior models of LED HDTVs with higher and better refresh rates.
