I love this Sony Bravia KDL40BX450 40 inch TV. This replaced a 116 pound Sony we had about 18 years. We do not play games so this was good enough for us.  I have one just like it in the wreckroom/bar. I do not have HD service but I have Directv and picture is great. The only complaint I had is the cord end fell apart while setting it up and had to get a new one. My old DVD's looks good on it too.
