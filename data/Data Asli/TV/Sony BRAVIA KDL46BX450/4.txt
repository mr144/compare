The first Sony 46&#34; arrived in a single box and despite Sony tech's best effort would not turn on.  Amazon sent a shipping label for pickup and immediately sent me another Sony TV which arrived in a very sturdy box in a box well packed and in two days.  I am a &#34;customer for life&#34;.  The TV picture is amazing.
