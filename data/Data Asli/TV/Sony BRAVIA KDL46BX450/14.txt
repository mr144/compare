Late Saturday (3/2/13) night with delivery promised for Wednesday (3/6/13) I placed my order. Then, I received an email that delivery had been moved up to Tuesday (3/5/13). Then I received a second email stating the delivery had been moved & it was scheduled for Monday (3/4)!  It arrived last night @ 8 delivered by UPS. Plan to unpack and setup today w/ son. Initially plan to setup w/ Sony Blu-Ray Player & Amazon PRIME, then pay for a FIOS connection later if I need it. Product review to follow,03082013 Update: Unpacked & setup TV.  Very detailed & sharp picture! Since the TV lacks 'smarts', I have connected it to an Sony BDP-S390 for some Smarts, including Amazon Prime. Works great w/o paying for FIOS TV Service, plan to subscribe later.  Just increased FIOS speed to 50/25 for $10/month, but it appears they may try to increase by $25 & I do not want any other changes in service confusing the matter.I also hooked-up an Philips CSS2123B/FT Soundbar, which has over 2,000 reviews on Amazon.  A definite improvement in sound quality w/ optical connection.
