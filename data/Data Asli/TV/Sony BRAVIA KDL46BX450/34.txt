I have owned the TV for  about 6 months now-Great picture quality and reliability.Good sound, but external speakers will help quite a bit.GREAT value for the picture quality and brand-name.  I would recommend to anyone buying a TV in this size range ALTHOUGH I would suggest getting 720p because the only media today that is in 1080p is blu-ray movies.  Not video games, not live TV, not streaming TV of any kind.  Just blu-rays.  I wish I had bought the 720p version now!
