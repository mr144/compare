I have only had this TV for a very short time, but I am already very impressed with it. I see no image artifacts, blur, or image shuddering at all. The color depth is more than adequate. My only real issue with it is the lack of standard AV composite slots. Aside from that, it is a great set. You can certainly do much worse for the money. KDL40EX640 is better than this TV.
