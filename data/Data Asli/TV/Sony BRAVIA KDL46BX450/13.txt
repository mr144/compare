I bought this TV refurbished from Walmart (nothing against Amazon, was just a better price) and I could not be any happier. I have been through countless TV's from Samsung's Plasma and LCD's to LG's LED and LCD screens. This Sony takes the cake by far! 40 inches is perfect for my apartment but what really surprised me was the sound quality. I understand that the smaller these TV's get the harder it is to put a decent sound system into them so they make them so you have to purchase a sound bar or surround sound. This TV has phenomenal sound and I only turn it up %20 of what it is capable of! One thing that is not stated on the description of the item is the functionality of the USB port. Most TV's with USB only support photo and music with limited formats. This one does not say if it can do video or not. To clear things up, it can. I have always been happy with Sony products; the design, the quality, they have the whole package! One thing I do want to mention is the refresh rate. Everyone seems to think that if a TV is 60hz that it will not be able to keep up with sports or fast paced video games. EVERYTHING that is broadcast is put out at 60hz or 60 frames per second. The only time a 120hz or 240hz TV would make a difference is if you are watching a Bluray. True Bluray has an output of 1080p at 24 frames per second. The reason it is not 'as good' on a 60hz TV is because 24 is not divisible into 60. There are 6 extra frames created to keep up with the signal causing a choppy look. If you had a 120hz or 240hz, it would run smooth because 24 is divisible into both. With this Sony LCD TV, they actually have two engines running; one for the 60 frames per second and one for 24. This allows you to watch Bluray with less choppiness. All in all, I would highly recommend this TV or any Sony product for that matter!
