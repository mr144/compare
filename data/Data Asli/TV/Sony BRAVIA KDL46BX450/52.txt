I found this TV disappointing. Connected to any HD equipment, such as HD Cable, HD Roku, Blue Ray, ETC, the noise is extreme at any setting. There is no way to customize sound. The sharpness is mediocre at best. In a side by side comparison  overall visual is by far inferior to my 60' Sony.I would not recommend it.
