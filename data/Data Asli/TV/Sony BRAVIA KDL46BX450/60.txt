This Sony TV is an amazing display, especially for its price. It offers full 1080p at a 60HZ refresh rate, along with an excellent contrast ratio and viewing angles. As a result the picture is crystal clear, even competing with TVs at a larger price range. It also has a light sensor, which adjusts the screen's brightness to how light it is in the room. It offers two HDMI, one component and two composite inputs for input options. It also has the ability to read photos and music right from a USB flash drive via its buit in USB port. One con about this display is its sound quality, which, like most flat panels nowadays, is subpar. This is easily taken care of with an alternate speaker system however. Also, this is not an LED backlit display, however the picture quality is so good you will not even be able to tell the difference.
