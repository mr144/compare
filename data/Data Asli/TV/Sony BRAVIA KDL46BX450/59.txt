do not worry about the limited 'only 2' HDMI that some reviewers have mentioned - You can easily get ( Amazon - 4 + stars) add on switch boxes for HDMI for from $ 10. to $ 40. for  aremote controlled' for the super lazy.as for my opinion of the 40' Sony, I have only had a few days. excellent so far. if it is durable, I am totally satisfied, for the price I knew I was not getting a top line model with all the bells & whistles.
