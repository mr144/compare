This is the 4th Sony Bravia 1080  HDTV I have purchased from Amazon since December 28, 2011. After reading all the reviews on Amazon and other sites and learning about 60Hz vs 120Hz I decided The Quality and Price was right ....The first one was a 40 inch for my grandsons.  They mainly use it for their xbox 360.  Even though it only has 2 HDMI outlets I figuered for the price they can plug and unplug as necessary.  It has a wonderful picture.  Great for their XBox and Great for watching basketball and baseball games . They also down load shows from their laptop .....Everyone is happy with the sound as they are in a small room.It was such a success in January I purchased the same 40 inch HDTV model for my daughter in law's birthday.  She records soap operas while she is at work and watches them in bed before she goes to sleep.  It was perfect for her but the room is a little larger so they hooked it up to their stero speakers.The 3rd was for me.  I have a Roku to watch Netflix and a DVD player, so I do have to plug and unplug..the plugs are color coded and the HDMI outlet is easy to see on the left side just in the back.  Great picture and sound for me.This last one is a 46 inch for the family room..  It is a large room, but the seating is about 7 feet away so a 46 inch is fine...they did hook up stero speakers......The picture is clear and the colors bright...They are looking forward for football season.  We all love our Bravias.They were all purchased from Amazon.  You can not beat their free delivery to me or across town to my family.
