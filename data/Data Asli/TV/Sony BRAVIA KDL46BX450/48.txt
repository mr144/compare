I like almost everything about this TV.I bought it to replace my 32' Bravia with 720p.  I wanted 1080, so I could use the TV as a computer monitor from the couch.  This product works fantastically for that.  The contrast is strong, the picture is clear, the Wii looks great on this, and text is sharp.My only beef is the lack of input jacks.  There just are not enough for my taste, and I have found that I have some jury rigging going on, in order to hear the sound from the computer, rather than just allowing me to send it directly.  Grumble grumble grumble.Really, this is a great TV.  My movies look WAY better, now.  I just miss being able to plug in everything I own.
