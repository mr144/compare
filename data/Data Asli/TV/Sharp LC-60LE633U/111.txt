Purchased this TV yesterday from H.H. Gregg. Not very knowledgeable sales staff but talked them down to a great price. Took it home attached the stand and plugged it in with no trouble. I do not agree with the main review about the stand being wobbly. We purchased a Samsung 59' Plasma the night before that we ended up returning and its stand was definitely wobbly. The Sharps stand in comparison is solid as a rock. Review is spot on about the menu. Easy to navigate but clunky. The apps menu is great and the favorites button works well. I do wish they had included an internet browser as one of the apps or some additional apps like YouTube, Blockbuster and Hulu but I have a PS3 connected that can provide those features. Who knows Sharp might include that functionality in future upgrades. The Wi-Fi connectivity is AWESOME. Very easy to setup and very fast even with my old B router. The only complaint I have with the set is when watching normal TV that is not HD. When your doing this your going to see a fair amount of cotton balls in the black areas of the picture. Solution do not watch regular TV! Honestly though, I have owned a lot of TVs in my 49 years and this one is hands down the best TV I have ever owned. Have watched Avatar, Star Trek, Ironman & Transformers all in Blu-Ray as well as Alice in Wonderland on Netflix and the picture is STUNNING. My wife and I sat on the couch with our mouths hanging open. For the size, picture quality and price point it is THE TV to own. My wife said and I quote 'Why does not everyone own a 60' Aquos. As Mr. Sulu Says 'OH MY!!'
