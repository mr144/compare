I love the picture and certainly have no complaints there, but if you intend to do a lot of streaming over the internet via Netflix and such I did choose another TV. The problem is that the TV connects to the interwebs through Sharp's server and Sharp's server is terribly unreliable. If you phone Sharp tech support they are very polite and very appologetic and assure you that everything will be fixed soon...uh huh, if you call 2-3 days soon. It's too bad that a TV this good is let down by an incompetent support structure.
