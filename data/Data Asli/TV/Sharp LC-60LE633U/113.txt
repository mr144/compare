Just bought this exact model at Brandsmart USA in South Florida. Watched 3 Blu ray movies over the weekend. Unbelievable clarity. Black levels are great. Wi-Fi works super fast. Netflix loads and plays flawlessly. So far no complaints at all. Will update soon. Newest model of 3-D shutter glasses are not yet available, so have not tried the quality yet. Very highly recommended.
