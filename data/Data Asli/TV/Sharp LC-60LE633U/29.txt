I have to be honest that I was a bit nervous after making my purchase.  I had done a lot of research and knew some people were complaining of clouding and other issues.  However, there was also great reviews on this TV as well.  The TV has been on my wall now for about a month and I cannot complain about one thing except for maybe the sound, which is typical for this type of TV.  The picture is spectacular and the 3D is even pretty amazing as well.  When friends and family come over they are amazed at the clarity of the picture.
