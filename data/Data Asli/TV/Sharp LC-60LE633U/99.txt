I ordered a 3in1 tv stand from Walmart ($179) and almost had it together when 'Pilot Freight Services' was knocking on my door. I had been dreading the task of trying to wrestle the huge box from the front porch into my family room. Worse, I had not really given any thought on how I was going to do it.  To my surprise the two delivery guys carried it right into the room.  They then started unpacking the box for me, plugged it in, put batteries in the remote, turned it on, and checked it out. I thought maybe I was going to get hit up for this 'brown glove' service but they explained that Amazon insists on them going through a checklist  with all large screen TVs bought directly from them.  Who knew.  Way to go Amazon!Within minutes of them leaving it was setup and plugged into my Dish HD receiver.  Wow, what a picture.  Before buying it I had gone down to Costco to see the one they had on display.  It was a lesser model (LC60LE832U) but it looked as good or better than any of the others on display.  Very bright, almost too bright but going through the manual and all of the settings it can be set to dynamically adjust the picture based on ambient light.CONS: 0  nada zeeerow!I may not be as much of a video connoisseur as some of the others who have posted, but I know what I like, and this is it.  I had done quite a bit of research and this model stacked up side by side with other brands with all of the features I considered important.  Your mileage may vary.  What put me over the top was the online diagnostics, troubleshooting and firmware updates.  Beats being on hold for 30 minutes only to speak to someone who does not even have a good grasp of English.  Ya can not ask for more.
