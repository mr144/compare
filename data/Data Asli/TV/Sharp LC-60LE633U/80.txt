I bought this tv for 1899.00 with 2 pairs of glasses. The good stuff, the television's best feature is that the television provide the best brightness that I saw. You will really notice it at best buy were the sharp is displayed next to the sony's, samsungs, panasonics, and lg's.  The quatron 4 colors is something you take for granted until you see it side by side with another tv displaying the same feed. The 3d effect is really good.  The bad stuff I did that the Internet features are useless! I do not mind because I connect to Internet using the ps3, but sharp dropped the ball on this because when you want to show this feature to your friends you will be embarrassed! The apps were most likely written by either an intern or a high school student..lol the buttons on the tv.. Look nice as the light up as they are touch sensitive, but they are a nightmare when it comes to using then to select settings on the menu, do not lose your remote..lol  but the worst feature that makes me mad is that the television just like many others do not display or read direct tv's 1080p signal which comes in at 24 frames. Therefore I can only watch direct tv at 1080i, which is annoying! If anyone'...'...........gets it to work or knows of a work around let me know...  The 3d glasses use a round watch battery and they are not rechargeable, the switch to turn on the glasses is retarded! You have to push it once and if it flashed 3 times then it is on 3d. If you push it again and it flashes 2 times it is then turn off, this causes one to forget it you left them on or off.. No big deal but it just goes to show you how sharp engineers think, a simple on off switch would have made more sense.  I am happy with the television because of the freaking brightness..  The size, the 3d and the price.. Worth it if you paid under$2000.00 dollars.
