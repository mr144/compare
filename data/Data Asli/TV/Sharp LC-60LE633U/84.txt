I was between the sharp LED and the Panasonic plasma.  When I saw this sharp on Amazon and was able to get the 835u on amazon as the stores were selling the lower end model I jumped at the opportunity.  I was originally not wanting the 3d but now that I have had a chance to watch some movies and play MLB the show in 3d I would not give it up.  The glasses which were free from amazon are not as bulky as some of the glasses I had tried.  The picture in non 3d is phenomenal and the colors really pop on this television.  The quattron really makes a difference with the yellows and skin tones.  I would recommend getting this television immediately
