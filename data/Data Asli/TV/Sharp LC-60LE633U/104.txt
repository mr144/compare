I purchased this TV after months and months of looking at different models to replace a 27-in Sony tube-TV I have had since 1999. I had trusted Sony and did not really want to switch models until I came across this Sharp HDTV. The TV arrived in perfect condition although took a little longer that I thought. Amazon uses 'Home Direct' to ship and apparently in my town, they come once a week. The set up was pretty simple although I had to re-program my DirecTV remote, since it could not detect the new TV. The picture quality is astonishing even on non-HD channels, is so hard to tell the difference. The size and at the same time, the thinness of the TV blew my mind. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a 60-in TV for such a price. With decent credit, Amazon 2-yr no interest on their card was hard to pass. I did not have to have $2000 plus taken out of my savings at once. Although, it did take me a while to really convince myself to do it, since obviously no one likes debt. Without a doubt, this is a nice TV and thus far, no regrets on my purchase. For now though, I still have the box in my garage, just to be on the safe side..which in my mind, its very unlikely. By the way, a correction on Amazon's specs about this TV. The contrast ratio is 8,000,000:1 and not 800,000:1 as they state. Also, sharpusa.com states there is a firmware download to enhance 3D picture among other improvements on their website. I did download it, but my TV already had the update so check on that, depending on when you purchased the set. Good luck.
