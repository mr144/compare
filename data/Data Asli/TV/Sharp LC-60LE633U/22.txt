And also the great TV picture It has now. And the 3D picture Is nice and bright most movies. I had several models from a local store at home and had to return 2 as the picture was bad on those models. This Is the 8 million to 1 contrast ratio. The very top of the line 60' TV of the year. It's a marvel no matter what your watching with any of the motion blur completely gone.I give this TV my highest rating, and highly suggest this for anyone looking for a large 3D TV. I have looked and looked and no TV looks like this one. This hooked up to my surround system In minutes. Easy set up. If I did have known this picture existed I did never even looked anywhere else or any other model. Everything Is so perfect. Black IS BLACK now.Highly reccomend.
