WOW..is all I can say about this excellent TV. We love everything about it. We wanted a 3D TV so we researched and compared in those other brick&mortar stores and found the picture quality was breath taking to say the least. We have owned other big sized LCDs so we are not strangers about the features. This Sharp LED 3D marvel is what all other makers should look up to ..yeah really..The picture is superb..the colors are simply amazing (quattron yellow does make a difference)..the sharpness and black contrast are as pure as it gets. You can also easily adjust the on screen settings. We played several 3D movies using a Sharp BD player a AV Receiver w/3D pass & high speed HDMI cables and talk about reality..my gosh what have we become..unbelievable. This TV came with a budled promo of 2 3D Sharp glasses to boot so it was a fantastc deal form Amazon. We highly recommend this TV..enjoy.
