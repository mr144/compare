Bought this on July 2011, and on Oct earlier it shown the horizontal black line. Per tech support and repair man, this requires to change whole screen which cost of the screen cost more than the TV itself.Really 15 months old ??? Go with Samsung or Sony.. do not waste your time for this sucker.Update : I paid 250 to get replaced to SHARP, they gave replacement TV and second one gave problem after 1 week installation.. this time static.. i have to tap back of the screen.Really not worth it.
