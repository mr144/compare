After a month long search we decided on this TV. We purchased from Amazon to get the two free pair of 3d glasses and got great on time delivery by Pilot. The Picture on this TV is just stunning. After getting it all hooked up and wall mounting I booted up Wipeout HD on the PS3 which is in 3d and I was blown away. My only complaints thus far are the remote which is a bit plain for a tv with this many features, The usb media function also has a little trouble reading the sound in some MKV files but I was able to work around that pretty easily.  Very Happy with this purchase.
