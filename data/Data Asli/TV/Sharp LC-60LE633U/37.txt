When I first started doing my search for a large screen HDTV over 55 inches I thought I had found the right one with the Sharp LC60LE835U. I could not have been more wrong. Bottom line is this set has very poor image quality and that is after Amazon sent me three different units and after full calibration on all three. Here are my concerns on this set.1. Where 720p should look better than 1080i, it is just the opposite.2. Uniformity of clarity is very uneven across the screen.3. The extra yellow pixel is unnecessary and at best annoying. You really have to back off on the saturation level of the yellow or anything yellow will smack you in the face. I wonder if this is why skin tones are so green.4. No clock and limited program description in display.5. Channel recognition is slow, very slow.6. My main complaint is the sharpness control on these sets needs to be set at about the +20 to + 40 range in order to really get the HD to shine. That is way to high. You should never have to approach mid point setting on your sharpness to get good HD image quality.7. Film mode and Motion enhancement. Set these two together and feel like you are watching video all day. Soap opera effect. It does a great job at this. Yuck!I suppose the bottom line is stick with Samsung LED LCD or plasma if you want truly great quality. But what I have found out is there are no sets over 55 inches that perform up too HD quality standards. Almost all reviews I have researched do not even mention 60 inch and above sets based on this fact. My Samsung 46 inch LNT series eats this Sharp for lunch and that's being polite.
