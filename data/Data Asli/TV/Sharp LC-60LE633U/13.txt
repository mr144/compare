We bought our TV in 11-2011, the picture is great, we love it. September 2012 a blue vertical line showed 3/4 on the right side. Opened a case with Sharp and after a long wait got a replacement delivered. The delivery guys asked if it was a blue line and commented it is common. The replacement was refurbished, which we expectedted, but it had several scratches to the bezel. Because of the hassle to get it off the wall and back on we were going to live with the scratches. Unfortunately about a month after receiving the replacement TV another blue line showed up 1/4 on the left. I am still waiting on Sharp to confirm they received the pictures they requested, and once again we'll have to get it down from the wall and be available for delivery. If you buy Sharp get the extended warranty, you'll need it.It was 10/20 when the second TV started showing a line on the left-hand side and I contacted Sharp for the first time. (On the second TV!) It was not until today 12/12 that the replacement TV, now the 3rd, arrived in the house.If you are set on buying this TV make sure you buy the extended warranty and do not mount it on a wall. Sharp delivers the replacement TVs in the house but it must be off the wall.
