Great TV.  The price I paid was amazing.  Friends think I must have spent a $1000-1500 more than I did and even after I purchased the unit, Amazon was selling it for $400 more than I paid.  No shipping and no sales tax as well.  As far as the quality is concerned, the picture is clear, full of color and vivid.  The size is perfect for the room.  The set up was easy although I must admit, I had my son do the set up.  I do not use the volume so I cannot comment on that.  Instead, I bought the ZVOX 580 system to provide the sound which has been excellent.  Prior to purchase,  I went to Paul's Big Screen TV to talk to the sales guy there.  He too recommended the Sharp over their competitors because the quality and price were unmatched.Highly recommend this tv.
