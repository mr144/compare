In past I have always bought Samsung LCDs (40' and 46') and have had great experience with them so far. Now, I wanted to get a bigger TV and looked at various brands including Samsung, Sharp, Sony and LG. I liked the new Samsung LED TV the best, primarily due to it is looks and my past experience. However, it was $550+ more expensive than Sharp with both have similar features and picture quality in my opinion. So, I opt to purchase Sharp to save some money. This TV has everything which I was looking for. Form pic quality, looks, sound, built-in Apps, Network connectivity, DLNA comptability, nice remote etc. I never imagined that the difference between 46' and 60' is going to be so huge until I got this TV. I have got lot to explore about it. However, I did get chance to play with the picture settings. So far, I like Dynamic the best. Just turn off the Movie option under Advanced settings (which makes subject comes out to give 3D effect) and rest of the Dynamic defaults are just fine.
