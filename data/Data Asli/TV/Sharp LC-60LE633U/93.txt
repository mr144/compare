This TV has a quality that has to be seen. Even the audio is far superior than previous models. Normal movies almost look 3D. It is worth buying. No regrets. The Netflix, Vudu and other online movie systems function great. I have cut my Directv already. Quality, quality...Hook-up is simple, setup a breeze.
