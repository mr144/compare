I bought this set on sale and could not be happier.  I deliberated between this and the Samsung 80 series, but for almost half the cost, the picture quality and features were too close to pass up.  It came bundled with two 3D glasses and was delivered quickly and well packaged.  My set suffered from the &#34;ghosting&#34; splotches on the dark screen and after failing to adjust it out I made a service call and Sharp replaced a couple of boards and greatly improved the issue.  Looks like other postings that there was a hardware issue related to this problem were corrected.
