The aquomotion 240 is horrible and the addition of a yellow pixel looks unnatural.  As a former installer for C City even with my ISF calibration kit was unable to get a picture even close to the DLP I was replacing.  Ended up returning for a different brand.  Was very disappointed expected more after reading the reviews.  Average viewer would probably be happy, but when purchasing a top of the line model I expected more and this was a big let down.
