Unfortunately nowhere in the item description does it mention this screen has a hi gloss finish, so as I have a lot of reflected light in the room, this TV does not work for me.I also have noticed the flashlight reflection in all four corners, especially bad in the bottom right, and this is very distracting when the screen is dark.This seems to be a known issue with some Sharp models, apparently something to do with the screws being overtightened on the panel during manufacture.So mine is going back.On a more positive note, the additional yellow Quattron does make yellows and golds more vivid, giving a better picture at a lower price than Samsung. Also remember that most of the Apps are sort of hidden within the Vudu application and all work well.When you call Sharp Customer Service they tell you they do not have any matte screens. However this is not true as Costco have the non 3D version of this TV and it has a matte screen. So yet another case of the sales staff having no product knowledge.
