I purchased this TV along with a Sharp 3d dvd player, and 2 sharp glasses from Brandsmart for $1100 package deal on sale. The tv has a beautiful picuture and great quality with great 3d. I have also used its conversion to play XBOX games in 3d and it is amazing. The only downside to this tv is the sound quality. I purchased the Bose Cinemate to accompany the tv. The speakers sound very tinny (not tiny) and seems to echo. I definitely recommend this TV for those who love a good cinema night.
