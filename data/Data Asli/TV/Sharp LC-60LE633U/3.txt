Wow. I love my Sharp TV!!!!!! 60&#34;, 240 HZ, 1080p, 3D, LED, HDTV. I paid $1400.00 for a used in new condition. I have had it now for 1 year. It is still the best picture I see on any TV. My friends have paid double and more for LG and Sony TVs with the same stats... And my TV has a better picture!!!!!! Great, great, great, buy!!!!!!!!!! I have got my eye on the 80&#34;.
