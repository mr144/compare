I spent some considerable time educating myself on all of the various LED flat screen models and brands. I have to say the stats are all over the place. Be careful with the big box stores or even the discount warehouse; I found that manufactures build custom models for them which have significant feature modifications.I purchased the 3D model, not because I am into 3D but the 3D models have the best feature stats.Once I zeroed in on my desired optimum features (8 million contrast, 240 HZ), I found that the Sharp 835U had all that I was looking for and it paid off!This TV is amazing! Picture perfect right out of the box, it truly does not get any better!Buying from Amazon was also a great move.. they have wonderful customer service!
