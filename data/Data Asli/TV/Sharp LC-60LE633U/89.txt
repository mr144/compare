We bought this TV and a week ago and are very impressed.  This TV will blow you away with the clarity and the different options.  The TV dropped in price by almost 75 dollars after we bought it and AMAZON credited my credit card the difference.  The no sales tax and free delivery were awesome.  The delivery company was very professional.  They unpacked it and helped set it up.  I also purchased the 4 year warranty for the TV.  It was almost half of what I wold have paid at Best Buy.
