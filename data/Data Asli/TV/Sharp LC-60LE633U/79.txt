for 1850$, this is good value for this 60'TV, Costco has similar model but no 3-D for 1900$, to make it short, it is 1000$ cheaper buy it at Amazon than Best Buy., easy setup, light weight, fairly good picture quality, the only down side is: the remote control is slow to response.The TV did not come with 3-D glasses.But this is the best quality 60' TV from Sharp in Sept.2011, with Dynamic Contrast Ratio: 8,000,000:1 , I am very happ with it. The newest 4-Color TV from Sharp the LE920 available in 2012, comes only 6,000,000:1
