UPDATE: Delivery was made on Friday 07/22 and I set up the TV over the weekend. It truly has an awesome picture. I went from a 61' JVC 720p rear projection set to this unit and I can honestly say the picture is at least twice as sharp and bright. Highly recommend this set to anyone wanting a larger screen HDTV. My only complaint is really a personal one. I wear hearing aids and need to use the audio out to my unit that broadcast to my headphones. There is only one audio out put and it is like a mini headphone jack so I need an adapter to hook it up. The sad thing is the set has a voice enhancement circuit, but it does not work with the audio out.
