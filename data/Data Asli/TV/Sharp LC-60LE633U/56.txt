I was nervous about this TV because of some clouding comments made at the AVS forum.  None to be seen on my end.  The picture is just breathtaking. We receive a lot of  WOW's from friends.  The price here is much cheaper than Bestbuy.  Only bummer is no glasses which are pricey.  The only negative to this TV, which I knew going in is that the sound STINKS badly and 2 months into the TV we just partially blew the speaker and now have to get that replaced. Without a sound bar or a dedicated system you will not be pleased but most TV's this thin share that problem.  In summary this TV picture is AWESOME.
