Exactly what Mogg said in his review 'Great Picture Quality, but the clouding was too excessive'.Great picture, connection options etc (one of the rare units that has two composite inputs!).  However I went through 4 of these units and most of them had the 'clouding issue' - like patches of smoke in various parts of the screen - noticeable only when room is dark and in a black background.Pros:One of the things I liked was you can change the cc fonts and colors on this (even for analog cc) unlike other TVs I have tried.  Also when using the menu you can still continue to see the video unblocked (in about 46 inch size) - that is a nice thing because you can use it that way if you are sitting somewhat close to the TV or if the standard def broadcast is of poor quality (which will look worse on a 60 inch).  Sound was quite better than the current Panasonic TV I have.Cons:Clouding, Clouding, Clouding.  Also one of the 4 units I went through seemed to have bad 'pixelation' compared to the others.  And one of them had a vertical line on the screen right out of the box on delivery.  Sharp needs to really UP their quality control.I tried to ignore the clouding, but for the price you pay for this TV I could not excuse it.  Eventually I settled with a Panasonic plasma (p55st30) which I am happy with.
