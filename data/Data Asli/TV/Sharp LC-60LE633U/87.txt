Since purchasing the LC60LE835U I could not be more pleased with the quality, the service and the price for value. After a few months of research we decided on this model of Sharp's and are so happy we did! The programming is user friendly, and the set up was a breeze. We did have a super install person standing by waiting to mount on our wall which helped! He's a pro and also was impressed with the picture quality. We have never made a purchase this large on line and were a bit reluctant... down to the delivery which was handled by a popular freight company- in an unmarked white panel van no less... We found that to be hilarious! Nonetheless, I had them take the TV out of the box, looked it over, had them plug it in and then called Sharp to verify the Serial # BEFORE they left my home. All checked out legit (I am sure they thought I was paranoid- but do not care)Saved loads of tax $ and Shipping fees by doing it this way, plus it went without a hitch. We also purchased an additional warranty for 5 years thru Sharp for peace of mind. Usually we do not, but price was so good, it was a no brainer.
