My wife was dead set on Sony as she cares more about name than the product.  She was upset when this came to the door.  The box was not even open and she kept saying, I am not going to like it and you are going to have to send it back.  It did not take long to hook it up and turn it on.  Within seconds, she stopped talking and was focused on the screen.I read a lot of reviews on the Sharp Aquos and most people are amazed on the quality of the product and picture.  Never seeing one in person, I went ahead and purchased it, and I have to say, it exceeded my expectations.  I know Sharp touts the color quality because of adding yellow to the three additive colors (RGB).  Sounded like snake oil to me, but this is the third flat panel we purchased and the vividness of the yellows, golds, and blues (not sure whey blue is much more vivid) is amazing.I purchased a couple 3D movies (Coraline and Tangled mostly for the kids) with this and some universal 3D glasses (Sharp branded 3D glasses are way overpriced) as this does not come with any 3D glasses.  I have used the display 3D in stores and was not impressed.  The wife and I watched Coraline the other day and it was nothing like the lame setup in the stores.  The 3D was very impressive.  I am looking forward to watching more 3D movies.Not the TVs fault, but it is hard to find a nice media center to fit this TV.  TVs are getting bigger faster than the furniture.  This is a massive 55' wide and 35' tall.I love this TV!
