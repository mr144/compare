This tv has severe clouding issues. They not only appeared in total black scenes but could be seen during normal veiwing watching Hulu plus, Netflix and also BD. 3D looks good but has crosstalk but nothing to stop watching 3D content. I returned TV after trying to live with its issues but went back watching my three year old Sony XBR8 which blows this tv away in PQ. I just wish it had 3d! Amazon was great as usual and returning such a big item was a breeze. I am definatky staying away from edge lit tvs from this point forward.
