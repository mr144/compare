Incredible buy and excellent deal. I ordered it from Amazon, the delivery company not only delivered it on time, but they also assembled it and saved me a lot of time and effort. The price along with free VIP delivery and no tax is an excellent deal from Amazon.The TV is excellent.I got the Disney 'wow' disc to calibrate the colors. The colors are just out of this world and bright. The blacks are excellent as well. The other features work very well too. (internet connection, apps, usb, pictures, music, file sharing). I think it is an excellent deal for the price and I am very satisfied.
