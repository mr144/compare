I rarely review products on Amazon, but I felt I must for this TV because it is so incredible.  I got it two weeks ago and it has completely altered my TV viewing experience.  It is so clear, it is like looking at real life.  And watching blu rays are a sight to behold.  But the real treat is the 3D viewing experience.  In the past two days I have watched Tron 3D and Tangled 3D.  Tron was an ok movie with beautiful visuals and Tangled was utterly beautiful and great movie, as well.  My wife, who could have cared LESS about 3D, was transfixed and considered the viewing experience  amagical'.Setting this TV up was so easy, I was surprised it was set up and ready to go in less than 5 minutes.  What a pleasure.  My only complaint is that they do not have a bigger Quattron version available yet, but this 60 inch set will do.  It was cheap, it is gorgeous, and it is very stylish, too.If you are in the market for an LED TV and you are not sure which one to get, get this one and you will be happy.
