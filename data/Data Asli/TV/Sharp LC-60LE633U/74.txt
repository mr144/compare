Awesome tv and great experience with Amazon! TV arrived on time, delivery company and personnel were polite and prompt. Basic delivery was all I had due to a remodel project. TV set up was easy. Picture is awesome, 3D is fantastic. Weak in internet options but that is not what i bought it for. Highly recommend this tv.
