Was very torn between the Samsung D7000 model and this sharp LE835U 60' TV.  Read a lot of negative reviews on Samsung for the flashing issues.  The sharp TV did not have any issues reported and was cheaper than the Samsung so went with the Sharp.  Have had the TV for two weeks and the picture quality has been outstanding when watching football, bb, DVDs and blue ray movies.  Playing PS3 games on it also surreal.  3D has been amazing with the sharp glasses.  Watching non-HD porgramming has been less than stellar though -but not sure if its like that on all HDTVs though.  Colors - seem very bright.  On non-HD programms have observed some color distortion.All in all very happy with the TV and it seems like I made the right choice going with Sharp and would recommend it to others.P.S. My first TV came where the screen glass was broken but Amazon was great about sending a replacement TV promptly.  Good service.
