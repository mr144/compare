Hello Shoppers.Ok let me start off, I do not have it, but I have watched on the TV multiple movies and shows. I will say it is a very good TV. Very smooth motion, very clear and great picture. It's true to it is specs.Now, to me, if anyone else is like this, it kind of felt like watching the Behind the Scenes or.... I do not know how to explain it. It made it look not... movie-like. You know, the movie-feel from the lighting, and motion. It's supposed to be smooth and 60FPS, but to me it was just very hard to get used to. Watching The Walking Dead on it changed the experience. It made it bright and too smooth, detailing the camera shaking. That's just me though. If you are like this, go in-store.
