I do not own this model but do own the Sharp LC-60LE810UN, a non-3D model.At 13 months of age, my set would provide only a black screen along with a flashing illuminator at the bottom of the screen (power-on indicator). I had the standard 12 month warranty plus 3 extra months due to signing up for the AquosAdvantage program. Since my set was within this 15 month time period, Sharp repaired it by offering to exchange it with a refurbished one. I accepted their offer and the exchange occurred yesterday.Both the original set and the replacement are beautiful to watch; I have been very pleased with the viewing experience.My conplaint is now Sharp will not sell me an extended warranty because my set is now a refurbished one, even though Sharp suggested it and provided it. They tell me that if my original set had been repaired in my home, I could have purchased an extended warranty since I have two months of warranty still in effect. I also pursued a Squaretrade warranty but they will not sell one to me since the set has less than 90 days of remaining warranty. So I essentially have a refurbished ~$1800 set, with no avenue for an extended warranty.My advice:- Consider purchasing a lengthy warranty early on. The company with 'Cost' in its name seems to offer a cost effective 5-yr service warranty on sets purchased there (I have not tried that service)- If offered a refurbished set by Sharp, be careful; you may lose the ability to purchase an extended warranty.I gave this three stars. I did have given it 5 stars based on viewing experience of my 60' Aquos LCD set. But now I am concerned about the service life, causing me to lower my score.
