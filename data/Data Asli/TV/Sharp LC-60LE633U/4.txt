Having owned this TV for a while, I will say that I like this tv, it has good picture and some nice features.  There are some shortcomings/annoyances that keep it from being a five star Tv.First, the speakers sound weak and thin, so if you want a more robust sound then a home theater surround sound is necessary.Secondly, the tv has the ability to connect usb devices including a usb hard drive to play photos, video and music, which is great, however, the limitation is that only certain file types will play on the TV.  It would be nice if this TV could play a wider variety of file types.  In addition, the file listings have an odd order and arent always in alphabetical order.  Another complaint related to this is I have yet to find a way when playing a video through the USB hard drive to get the sound to play through my home theater.Third, the tv claims it works well with DLNA.  I have found that with streaming movies for example, it becomes a slow impossible mess.  IT seems that this feature was not perfected and with Sharp seemingly no longer providing firmware updates for the TV (it has been several months since the last one), it looks like there will be no more fixes to help these features.Overall, I really like this Tv but the shortcomings keep it from being a five star TV.  It is too  bad that the latest tech features did not quite live up to my expectations.
