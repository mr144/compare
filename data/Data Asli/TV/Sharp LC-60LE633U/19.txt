This TV is amazing!!  I have had it for a little over 7 months now and I can not get enough.  With the proper connections and media, you will not find a better TV for the price.  I was considering the Sony XBR and decided on the Sharp 60' 835.  Amazon deliver to the house with no issues.  My wife have been pleasantly surprised by the TV.  We have found that we are weaning ourselves off the cinema. ;)
