I was a bit worried about purchasing this TV because the price for what you get seemed so low.  But WOW - WHAT A SURPRISE!  The 3D is amazing for 3D movies, and the SIMULATED 3D for all programs looks almost the same.  Football - puts you right in the midst of the action.  Even the NEWS is amazing to watch.  If you want a BIG BANG FOR YOUR BUCK, you can not beat this SHARP 60'.
