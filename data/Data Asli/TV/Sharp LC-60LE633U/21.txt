I have been looking at LED TV's for about one year. I have read a ton of reviews, and went to stores to see some in person. My son has a Samsung 55' that is fantastic. I wanted just a little bigger to replace my 57' DLP. This 60' really filled the bill. Unbelievable picture. While running Blu-Ray movies I just do not know how it could get any better without being there. There is only one problem that I have ran in to. The 3D requires that you be within 7.2 feet. 6 feet is better. That's very close. I did not read anything about that before I bought it. When I first tried 3D I sat in my usual spot about 10-11 feet away. I thought the 3D was not working. Then I started reading the manual, and found I should be closer. It works great! Wow, what a picture. But you do have to be close to get it right. The TV sends out a signal to your glasses. I guess the signal is not strong enough to reach 11 feet. But I only watch some movies in 3D so I guess it will have to do. I do not think you could get a better looking set for the money. Speakers? Do not buy this or any other LED thinking that you will not need speakers, because you will. You just have to watch a live baseball game in HD WOW!
