My background: 32yrs USMC, Aircraft mechanic, Automotive mechanic so I am a little above average on connecting the dots.  For reception, I am connected to a cable network.  I was hyped to get this t.v. for gaming and movie viewing.  Being military, I purchased this at my local exchange so I saved the sales tax which I thought made it a deal I could not pass up, I wish I had.  Pros:  It's big so split screen is easier to play.....that's it I am afraid.Cons:  The picture quality is nothing extraordinary or even great. Tuning the darn thing will drive you to pull your hair out and make you curse your decision to buy.  I will not waste my time to even count all the different adjustments you can 'try' and make.  Why Sharp marketed such an UN-user friendly device I'll never know.  Now, you can search on line for others settings to try and save time and effort but good luck.  I have mine set to the highest sharpness and it is no better than my old box tv.  The inability to fine tune is compounded depending on what you are watching as everything is not in HD meaning, spending so much for such a tv is a waste of money.Sound system:  They might not have even bothered.  To say you'll be immediately sad is an understatement.  Add on speakers start at around $100 and go up to $500.  So now you have spent $1500 dollars for the tv, plus tax and then you have to shell out another $100 +, it'll make you cry.My recommendations: If you want a big tv, stop at 55'.  55' and below have fair prices and a much better picture quality.  Not to mention you'll save about $400 dollars and allot of gray hairs!  Look for a tv with speakers on the side or front, not bottom!Maybe in 5 years technology and networks will catch up to this size tv however now, it is not there.
