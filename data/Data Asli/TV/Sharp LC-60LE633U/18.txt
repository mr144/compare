I have had 2 of these TV now and both have the same problem.  When the screen is light/white you'll see 'black clouds'.  From reading other reviews it seems like this is a big problem for this TV.  When the background is not light/white and I do not see the 'black clouds' the picture is nice (although during fast action, like during a baseball game, sometimes the picture does get pixelated).  Buyer beware.
