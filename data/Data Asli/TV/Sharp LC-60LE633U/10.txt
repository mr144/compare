Worked perfect for about 11 months than all the sudden it does not turn on anymore only the power light flashes but screen does not come on... Will take it to repair on monday probably burnt capacitor on the power board... Had a UPS and everything so that i could not get any electric schock issues but i guess its the TV itself... Things melt after a while...kind of like how the xbox use to do... So disapointed... Hopefully its a quick fix.
