Great color and picture in either 2d or 3D modes. 3D images seem to project well beyond the screen.  The TV screen pivots on its base to some degree, which allows for a better viewing angle if you sit off center.The optional active 3D glasses are not as cumbersome as some reviewers mention. Slightly large on my 4 and 5 year old children, but the straps (included with the glasses) help it in place.  However, if you are watching the TV in 3D mode during the day near windows, close the blinds.  The 3D glasses seem to polarize the blue sky, constantly blinking between lighter and darker...similar to SLR cameras with a polarizer on the lens (less the blinking effect of course).  Viewing angle of the 3D glasses are good too if you sit well off center.You can buy 3 years extended warranty from SquareTrade for $99.99 purchased from Costco Wholesale. This is very low in cost for a piece of mind.
