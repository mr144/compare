I purchased this TV from Paul's TV through Amazon earlier this month.This is a beautiful TV. It is also incredibly thin, which is great for the wall mounted installation.I purchased a pair of Sharp 3D glasses on ebay.I have the TV hooked up to a HTPC with a GT430 video card . I watched 'Resident evil afterlife' 3D Blu-ray. It was breathtaking.I did not test the OTA HDTV tuner as I do not have an antenna hookup in the room where the TV is at the moment.I have not tried the DLNA feature either.Pros :The picture is very bright and just amazing. Much better than other manufacturers like Sony and Vizio.This is a really nice size for a large roomWhen watching 1080p/60Hz sources, the picture is incredibly smooth. The 240 Hz refresh rate is absolutely amazing. I may have to watch this TV more even though the screen is only 1/4' of the size of my projection screen.The wifi really works well. I have it working with wireless N on the 5 GHz band connected to a Cisco E3000 router about 50ft away. I can stream movies/previews from Vudu at the maximum quality, over 9 Mbit/s sustained. This may seem little compared to the 300 Mbit/s theoretical of wireless N, but it is actually impressive that there are no dropouts.The price was excellent. It was the same as the 832 model at Costco which is not 3D. I see that it has now gone up by over $500 since I purchased it.It has a lot of inputs - 4 HDMI, 1 component, 1 VGACons :3D picture is dimmer than 2D. And you can not watch the picture lying down with the 3D glasses, the polarization dims the picture too much.The built-in sound is weak. But that's expected on all TVs. You just have to pair the TV with a separate audio system.I could not get the HDMI Audio Return Channel feature to work with the Onkyo HT-S5300 HTIB. It could be due to the receiver and not the TV, though the TV manual says this feature only works with other Sharp Aquoslink equipment.
