I picked this TV up today, after a great effort in researching which tv fit my needs.  At first we were looking at the 70 inch LC-70LE733U at sams club alongside the LC-60LE832U.  The new tv is to replace an aging Hitachi Ultravision 65 inch projection that has served me well for 8 years.  Not wanting to defy the law that states TV sizes should always go UP my attention was focused on the 70 inch.  Then came the day, I actually went to buy the TV, and was astounded with all they had in the box was an inferior model the LC-70LE640U. and the only LC-70LE733U they had was the one on display.  Arrruugggg..  So with some groaning I started to look more closely at the LC-60LE832U there at sams.  I was about ready to purchase it, when I recalled that days earlier I had been in the USCG Exchange and noticed a 60 inch sharp TV, I took a picture of it with my phone and dismissed it.  Back at Sams club as we were about to purchase the LC-60LE832U I remembered the pic I took of 'that other tv' at the exchange.  Turns out the one at the exchange is the LC-60LE835U.  A much nicer set and was on sale at the exchange for $1649.  Much less than the inferior model at Sams club.  Then in addition, my wife noticed a sight stating that the particular model we were buying was eligible for an additional 10% off.  YaY.  we loaded it on the cart, and as I paid the cashier, I reveled in the fact that i had to pay NO SALES TAX on this fine machine, and ended up loading the tv in my truck for the out the door price of $1484.97.Got it home and all hooked up, amazing picture and easy setup. I could not be happier
