For all you who are like me, thinking you can watch Amazon videos or free Crackle movies on your new Sharp TV, think again. Sharp has pre-installed apps that only they control. You cannot add third party apps like Amazon or anything else for that matter. I contacted Sharp about this and they responded with a form letter telling me that I can ONLY access what is installed in the TV.  Unless someone comes out with a hack, which I hope they do, then you are left with a simple web access for Netflix, Hulu, etc. that is pre-installed.And the four color is mostly a sales hype. The picture quality does not look any better than my Sony Bravia.Update: After using this TV for awhile I found that the web access goes through Sharp's servers.  There is no direct web access.  So I purchased the Logitec Revue with GoogleTV and greatly improved my reception and loading speed.  Hense to say, Sharp's servers leave a lot to be desired.I still stand by my original rating though because it did not meet my expectation of what I thought it should do.  Not every device is perfect for everyone's needs.  Each to his own.  My rating is not to cut the product but to inform others who might be looking for the same functions as I was.  If I rated it perfect then others would pass it off as another praise report.I have bumped it up by one star though because the picture quality of the set is not so much as the display as it is with Sharp's server. Which, by the way, their server has been off line a lot. And you have NO access when their server is down even though you have a good internet line.
