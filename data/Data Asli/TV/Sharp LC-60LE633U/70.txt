I purchased this TV about 6 months ago and wanted to wait before writing a review so I could be sure of it.  I have NO REGRETS of purchasing this Sharp Aquos Quattron TV. Its bright and vivid... The picture quality is stunning!!  Everyone that comes to see this TV is in awe of its beautiful picture.  I would HIGHLY recommend this TV!  I spent about 2 months researching this purchase, and to this day I feel I made the best possible choice.  You have to see it to believe it.  Simply Amazing!
