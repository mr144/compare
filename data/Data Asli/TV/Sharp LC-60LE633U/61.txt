After seeing this model in the store, the picture quality and vibrance is what made me decide on this model.The picture is crisp clear, very colorful and just pops!It was better than the the Samsungs, Sonys, LGs, etc that cost $1000 more.For the money, it is the best 'bang for the buck' for a set with these features, Quattron, 3D, Apps, Wifi, LED, etc.The only reason that I did not give this TV 5 stars is because of Sharp's quality control.I went through 7 exchanges (8 TVs total), before I received one that did not have annoying flaws in the screen.I know I am very picky, and most people will not notice the things that I do, but if you are very picky, this might not be the model for you.Many of the TVs I received had bright spot about the size of a nickel in 1-3 of the corners of the screen about 1' in. They are noticable in light scenes and very annoying. Almost as if someone has smushed their finger int he TV and left a mark.Most of the screens I received had very uneven backlights or 'flashlighting', thus in dark scenes and especially at night, the blacks looked VERY splotchy.One of the screens I received had dirt inside the LCD panel itself, at a distance you would not notice it much, but I did not find this to be acceptable quality control on a $2000 item.Finally, #8 appears to be close to perfect, no bright spots in the corners, no flashlighting to be seen, and no dirt in the panel.The first 7 TVs I received were all manufactured in August 2011, the last one I received that is perfect was made October 2011.Maybe the first ones I got were just a bad batch, or maybe Sharp got so many returns and complaints that they amped up their quality control now.Either way, I am very happy with my purchase. I love the TV. It has an amazing picture and all the features you could want.Amazon's willingness to exchange this TV numerous times, for free, just to  amake me satisfied', has earned me as a customer forever. They may have lost money on me over this TV deal, but they will make it back in future purchases. I am just glad I got a good one finally and do not have to box them up to send back any more!! :-)
