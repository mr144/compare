My husband and I have been waiting for quite sometime to purchase our first nice big flat screen TV for quite sometime now. Not wanting to jump at just anything as this is such a large investment we both had done our homework in the reseach department. Ran across this beautiful Sharp 60 inch with full HD along with the enjoyment of watching 3D movies at just a couple simple clicks. We were lucky enough to purchase this Sharp through QVC on the easy 6 payment plan that QVC had posted only for 1 hour as a special at seventeen hundred dollars. This also came with  set of two rechargable 3D glasses that fit quite light and extreamly comfortable. The minute we turned this TV on and ran the simple set up our cable man arrived with or high def cable box. He showed us all the goodies that this TV had to offer us. Both my husband and myself were totally blown away with how chrisp and clear not to mention that beautiful colors that we had never experienced before. We have had this beauty of a TV now for a little over a week and we have to  say that sharp really did right by this particular TV.Outstanding and one of the absolute fantastic investments we have ever made over the past 18 years. If this had an option to rate this with 1000 as a rate? Sharp would have our review vote at just that. The very best of the best is finally arive. Our hat is off to you Sharp for a job well done. Thank you Sharp!  :0)
