I just received this TV and although picture quality is excellent in bright scenes and pictures, the quality of dim scenes is very poor due to the flashlight problem.  Three corners and a spot on the left side are leaking much more back-light into the picture.  This effect is very uneven, not in every corner or edge.  I will be returning this TV.  I am just undecided on whether to get the same model or try a different brand.  Response to TV remote is often very slow...  I have attempted to contact sharp tech support and so far no response.The shipper PILOT was a total disaster.  It took three times to get the TV delivered.  1st attempt they scheduled a time 1 to 5 and called the day of schedule deliver at 12 to cancel (TV did not make it on truck).  2nd attempt they showed up or even called.  Final successful attempt, they were 1 hr late delivering.  Driver did not offer to unpack and test TV as he was supposed to.
