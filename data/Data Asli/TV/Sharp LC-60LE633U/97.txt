The TV is nothing short of increadible.  It has the most vibrant and true colors I have ever seen on a TV.  The settings are all-inclusive, so you can adjust everything exactly to your liking.  When I first powered it on it came up in 'Standard' mode, which was very dim, even with the amount of light I had in the room.  I adjusted it to 'Dynamic' and customized some of the settings, like the lower range of APC and it is amazing!I configured the wi-fi with no problem so it could get updates, but I do not use the apps, as their VERY limited.  My sony blu-ray has so many more so I use it instead.The TV is incredibly thin and looks great on my wall, using my low-profile Sanus mount.The TV was a great deal from Amazon, which included 2 pairs of the 3-D glasses.  I really do not care much about the 3-D, but at least it has it so I can grow into it.  My blu-ray is 3-D, so maybe I'll purchase a 3-D movie and try it out one day.The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is that the backlighting does not light the screen evenly.  This is not normally noticeable, unless it is displaying a screen with all one light color, especially white.  I contacted Sharp about it and sent photos and they said this is within specification, so there is nothing wrong with it.  I agreed that it did not appear to be a defect, but merely how it is designed.  They said the differences in brightness are due to the edge-lit pannel.  My girlfriend got the 46' model of the same TV and it does not have this problem, but I suspect that's because it is a smaller screen and the light is not having to spread out and cover as much area.  I think the 60' model could have used more backlights, placed closer together to cover more evenly.  BUT, all and all I love it and I can live with this, as the pros far outweigh this one con.
