This is a really excellent LED TV, Excellent 3D and 2D Pictures. Brilliant colors - probably since they added yellow to the existing Green, Blue and Red.The TV automatically detects 3D picture and switches to 3D mode and back.The Sharp glasses are also excellent.I have mounted this tv on the wall as they are ultra thin and very light.Sharp does not advertise as effectively as it is competitors, that is why people lose money by paying higher prices for Samsung, Soni etc. Why pay more?This is the best 3D tv - you got to try it. It have tested others too.(I have another sharp 42 inch tv that I bought in 2007 - I never had any issues whatsoever - it is still going strong on the 5th year)
