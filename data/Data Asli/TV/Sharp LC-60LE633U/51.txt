Purchased this 60 inch HDTV for someone who had a Mitsibishi 65 inch television. Screen may be smaller but the picture quality is so much more better than the previous one that it does not matter. The TV wasvery easy to set up and we are very pleased with all of the connections and inputs featured on this TV. We also like the TV's slim design and the fact that it will not need a replacement light bulb every few months like the Mitsibishi TVs. We also happy with the interface menu on the television. What we wanted above and beyond is a TV with a good color picture and in that regard you can not go wrong with this TV. I think Sharp's addition of yellow to the RGB color scheme makes a difference to me compared to the television we had. As of the writing of this review we have yet to even view the television in 3D. Ca not wait to do that. Would highly recommend this TV to anyone. Purchase on Amazon for a good price!
