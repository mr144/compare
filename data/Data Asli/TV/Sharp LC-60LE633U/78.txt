Ca not get enough of watching 3D shows on this TV! DirecTV has a lot of terrific 3D programming now by the way. The picture quality on my 60' Aquos Quattron has to been seen to be believed. 3D Blurays on it are even more spectacular! I have looked at quite a few 3D TVs in stores and none compare to this TV. It has much more positive 'Z' effect than any others I have seen (picture coming forth from the screen opposed to just depth). I will not be paying for anymore overpriced 3D movies in the theatres anymore!
