Very nice TV.  Have not had much problems with it yet.  Loading update too many times of pressing retry to get it to load most of the icon in the app page are worthless.  Face book works great though. The media network link up why make a TV hook up to your computer and let it be limited to doing only basic things that your computer can do, that part really sucks as well as not having PnP so you can watch other channels or play video game while you watch your Favorite show.
