The sharp 60' tv is a disappointment to me. First is the very slow tuner which is no good for channel surfing and the info screen on the top left corner is to small to see. The apps are nothing more than pay per view movies.The few other apps that are there keep going on and off and do not work well if at all.there is no browser so you cannot get youtube,crackel or any other free movie stations.It is a good tv but not worth 2500.00,not even with the electronic glasses.
