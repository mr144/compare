Just before Christmas the price dropped and I took the plunge into 3D. The main reason I bought this was because of the 60 inch size and the Sharp reputation.  The quad LED with LCD at 240 Hz is amazing. Nothing out there comes close. Easy set up. I was enjoying a movie within 30 minutes of opening the box.
