Bought this t.v. through BB during Superbowl weekend. Got a great deal on it too! The picture quality is awesome, and yes there is the infamous 'light bleed' clouding effect during very dark scenes. This bothers alot of people, but most LED tv's have this problem. If this bothers you, go Plasma. Watching sports, 3d/blu ray movies, and playing video games on this set is an absolute joy. I did a little bit of tweaking with the picture settings via CNET editor specs and bought the Disney calibration disc (which I yet to open). This t.v. even upgrades the picture quality of regular non-HD cable programming. 3D tech is Active so you have to shell out for the expensive glasses. I was debating between the Samsung, Sony, and LG LED 3D sets, and went with this. If I had to do it all over, I did make the same choice. THE END.
