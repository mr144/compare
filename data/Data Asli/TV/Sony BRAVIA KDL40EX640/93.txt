It's hard and silly to criticize such a great piece of technology, but there are now many great HDTVs to choose from. So the devil's in the details (Where's Steve Jobs when we need him, oh,forgot, he's redesigning Heaven.)PROs: The picture's awesome with cable & DVD (non-bluray) player, even with all the default settings, the internet connection worked like a charm (WPA security, Motorola AT&T router), and it has all the input/outputs that you would reasonably need. Mounting to the table top stand was easy.CONs: The remote is terrible. The selector dials and buttons are too close together, so you end up pressing the wrong buttons even after practice. The remote is not illuminated (considering the world's economy, Iran, Syria, N. Korea, etc., ridiculous to worry about) and there's no iPhone remote app for this model. Helpful info. is missing from the manual, like all the screw hole diameters and depths for mounting, and some of the inputs are not described (like the mini-stereo jack, which not all users would know). There's no ordering information in the manual or online for the kit to secure the TV to furniture (although there are plenty of third party solutions - I got the Sanus Systems ELM701B1, which works great.). You have to call the Sony store to find out. The audio is average, not surprising for such a thin device. The internet browser's worthless. This model does not have wireless keyboard capacity, which in retrospect, would have been a help.COMPS: Without electronic testing gear, seems equal to our 1.5 y old Samsung 6500 in all respects. It is not as incredibly thin as the Samsung, but still pretty thin. Has the same inputs/outputs.Misc: Have had good luck with Square Trade, so purchased one for the Sony. The Sony warranty offered on the product page is not directly from Sony even though it says Sony, and on the phone the rep recommended buying the warranty directly from Sony, because they use authentic, new Sony parts.
