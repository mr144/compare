I purchased this Sony mainly for the advertised internet capabilities and I must say after finally getting it set up that I am very disappointed. I wanted to be able to watch network programs via my home wifi network. Unfortunately the web browser on the TV will not download software required to stream video. Bummer. I will have to hook my computer to the TV to view programs I want to watch off the internet. I could have done this with a lower priced TV. You can watch Netflix and other programs that are included with an app on the TV and you can enter a URL address but the capability is very limited by the web browser.
