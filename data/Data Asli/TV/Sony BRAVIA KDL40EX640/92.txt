After looking at the available TV's I selected this one. Other reviews indicate visible light on the edges of the screen, I have not seen this on the one I received. The only problem I had was how to attach external speakers. I spent a lot of time on the phone with Sony help to discover that RKN215PM would work. However the part is not available from Sony and no one else shows the part. I did find that Radio Shack had the part I needed. It is a Y-adapter 1/8' Stero Male to Dual RCA (Phono) Female part number appears to be 274-0883. It solved the problem and I am well pleased with the TV.
