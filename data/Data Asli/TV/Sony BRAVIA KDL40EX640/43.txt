SONY has been our only choice when it comes to buying TV. And we have had no problem. The resolution is perfect. We love the internet function. Its so easy to set up. Looks great in our dining area. I would recommend this 40 inch Sony Tv to evrryone. Worth the price. Its so thin unbelievable. I saw some complained about the sound. Its just prrfect . Has good sound quality. Thanks SONY
