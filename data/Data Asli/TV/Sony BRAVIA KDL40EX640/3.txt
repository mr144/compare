Our old Mitsubishi 27&#34; tube TV that I bought in 1990 FINALLY bit the dust.  Never remembered those &#34;state of the art&#34; TV's weighing so much!  So decided to put our 32&#34; Sony LCD in the guest room and buy a new 40&#34;.  Read reviews andpast history with Sony led me to this LED TV.  Was somewhat apprehensive with the reviews about how horrible the audio on this TV was.  Since it was going in our bedroom, we would not be hooking it up to an audio system, if the sound was really that horrible, would we even be able to hear or understand the audio.  After looking at a number of different makes and models and prices, we still came back to the Sony.  Typical Amazon purchase!  Ordered on Thursday evening.  Arrived Monday morning!  Set it up on Saturday since we were too busy to start what we thought might be an extended process.  Also, wanted to really have time to &#34;listen&#34; to the sound since if it was truly that &#34;horrible&#34; we planned to send it back!  Easy setup! GREAT Picture! Fine sound! Is it the same sound that you would get connection the TV to a surround sound 5.1 external unit? Of course not! Is it fine to watch and listen to? Absolutely! I truly do not understand the significant negative reviews on sound quality.  Maybe my ears do not hear like they did years ago.  But I was almost expecting painful noise.  What I got was a great picture and fine sound.  I highly recommend this TV.
