This is not the least expensive LED flat screen TV, but we liked the picture and image controls our twenty year old Sony Trinitron so much I decided to stay with Sony, and I am glad I did.  I am in the movie business and I need to be able to control the picture and color exactly and this unit lets me do so.  The standard settings are excellent yet I have the controls to adjust things when I need to -- controls I have not found on less expensive brands.  The Sony image is absolutely gorgeous and everything else seems to work just fine.
