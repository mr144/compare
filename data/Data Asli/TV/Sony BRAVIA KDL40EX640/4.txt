Remarkable, outstanding picture, simple set up, perfect size for our room.  Sound is good, with many ways to tailor it to your taste and needs including a &#34;clear voice&#34; setting and a &#34;steady sound&#34; feature to minimize changes in volume between programs and commercials, which are often louder.  Easily connected to my stereo system.  As for the seller: also excellent!  TV came more quickly than expected and was exactly as described.  I would buy from them again without hesitation.
