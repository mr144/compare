We have had nothing but positive experiences with this TV. Well, OK, the one negative is that everyone in the family wants to watch this TV because it is so much better than our old TVs. The picture is great. There is some screen glare, which we get around by pulling the curtains or turning off lights. What we really love is that Netflix, Amazon and Hulu are built in so we were able to watch movies and TV shows almost immediately. It's been great for catching up with Downton Abbey or watching House of Cards -- both are much better on the big screen, rather than on the computer screen.
