Delivery was well orchestrated and product arrived on time with excellent service as I changed the delivery location with the service provider at the last minute.  The TV picture is beautiful even in a room with a lot of sunlight. The Netflix built in client is superb - much better than connecting the HDMI cable up every time we want to watch a show.  We hooked it up to DirecTV with great results.  Skip the 3D as its not even close to the theater experience.  Only complaint is the speaker system is weak and could be improved.  I recommend getting one of those inexpensive surround sound systems.
