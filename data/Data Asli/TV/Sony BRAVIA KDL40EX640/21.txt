The picture quality on this set is simply astonishing.  I thought the KDL40V4100 was great with SD imagery, this thing blows it away, and that's not even mentioning what it does with HD imagery!  It often looks like I could almost step into the picture!I picked this one because it had the same features I picked its predecessor for, but several generations more refined, which makes a huge difference.  I am still getting it dialed in, but I am quite pleased with it.  Namely I wanted the built in 'up-conversion' (maybe not the right term, but it describes it well) of SD content, the sound leveling feature, and voice zoom feature.A word on the sound.  I am no audiophile, but I do have some background in running medium-sized (~12 channel) mixer boards, so I have some practice at listening critically.  That being said, for television viewing, I mostly just want to be able to pick out the dialog, and have the rest of the sound be reasonably decent.  This sound is not astonishingly good, but I did rate it much better than  areasonably decent.' Of course it probably helps that I am placing the set free-standing in a corner with no enclosure, so that the rear-facing speakers can actually pick up depth from bouncing off the walls behind it.  If I did completely boxed in the back-side, I did expect it to sound pretty muffled and muddy.  Aside from that, I have found it to have a stronger volume output than the last one, and we are not using the 'voice zoom' feature that we so prized on the last one, as this set brings out voices quite well without it, and turning it on does make the sound a bit tinny overall.I did not want to replace the old TV yet, but if I had to, I am glad we got such an upgrade in performance in the deal.
