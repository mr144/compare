Wow, what a difference the picture has on this tv. The people could just walk right out of the set at you. This is our third Sony and this one is our first LED. Big difference from the LCD. Great buy and easy set up. The only negeative is it blurrs some scenes in fast motion. But not every scene, still it is a great tv.
