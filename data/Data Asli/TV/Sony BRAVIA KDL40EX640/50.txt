I have been a Sony fan for many years. I worked for them for 16 years and have never owned another brand of TV. When it came time to upgrade my 32' in the bedroom everyone was recommending Samsung,saying they have surpassed Sony. I compared them a lot in stores. The color of the Sony just looked more natural.Last Friday UPS delivered an early Christmas present, the Sony 40'. I love the design,very simple and clean. Love how thin it is compared to my old XBR.Right out of the box the picture was perfect. I have watched lots of different things on it and it is really incredible. There is absolutely no motion blur.Some reviewers have complained about the sound. It's not that bad but I did just order the Bose Solo Sound system which a friend has and sounds incredible.I also love the fact that the TV has no 3D capabilities. I do not like paying for something I will never use.All in all a great set I am totally happy with. Should last me until Apple comes out with a TV!
