Although I have only had it for a few months, I still gotta say that this Sony BRAVIA KDL40EX640 40-Inch 1080p LED Internet TV is the most awesome bedroom TV I have ever owned.  A little too small for use in a living room, den or entertainment center, it works just right in the bedroom, probably the same for a dorm room or other small space.  That said, even though it is 1080p and LED, I would not use it for gaming.......go 55&#34; or bigger instead.  All-in-all though, an awesome TV!
