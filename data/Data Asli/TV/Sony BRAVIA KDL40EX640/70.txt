I just finished reading all of the reviews for Sony Bravia TV's and I have a couple comments. For the money you are not going to find a better TV out of the box if you are smart enough to turn it on and make a few very simple adjustments. My second comment is that obviously there are a lot of people who are not intelligent enough to own even the simplest form of consumer electronics! Please people...blaming the television and giving it fewer stars because UPS did not deliver it on time, or you are too ignorant to figure out the Internet or the buttons on the remote are too close together, etc.!!?? One person even blamed the TV for making them dizzy....get a good pair of glasses or quit smoking so much weed before you watch a movie!! Grow up people!!
