We bought a Bravia 18 mths ago.  The picture quality is great.  (although for the 3 times we have watched a 3D video, it is probably not worth it to pay extra for 3D; also the experience, while you can see the difference, is not impressive).the frustrating things about the TV are:1.  channel switching is slow.2.  web enabled functions are very slow.  e.g. netflix runs slower and freezes far more often on the Sony than on a desktop computer (same wi-fi network).3.  finally--the Wi-Fi function stopped working after 15 months...  (one good thing about the Sony is that it had a USB port so that we can use a plug and play external Wi-Fi adapter)conclusion:  Sony should just sell a TV at a lower price without 'enhancements'... the internet features are just like 'free software' on a computer.... it takes up memory; eventually slows down the system and is not worth the extra $.
