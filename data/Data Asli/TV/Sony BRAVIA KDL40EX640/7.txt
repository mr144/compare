Bought this TV from Amazon March 1st 2012. dilvery and packaging from Amazon was wonderful. Tv ran great for 410 days then quit. Control board burned out. Call Sony then there answer was TV is under warranty for 365 days and no longer.  I would think a company like Sony would try and treat there customers a little better and be on some help. Looks like they do not want retun customers,,  Last Sony I will ever buy.
