Me and my husband just set up our new sony led tv last night and we could not believe how amazing the picture quality was! We did not even have to adjust anything, it was perfect out of the box! I am not sure why other people had problems with it, but for us it was absolutely the best choice! We have always been loyal sony buyers and never had a problem with any of their products, which is why we keep buying from them. This tv is just another great product!*UPDATE 2/2013*It's been almost a year and everything is still working perfectly! We watch a lot of movies and the tv gets used on a daily basis. We read through all the settings in the manual to play around with the tv and it does have a lot of features we did not know it had. We highly recommend reading through the tv manual to become more familiar with it. Still a great purchase!
