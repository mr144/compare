The TV was delivered on time, packed very well and easy to install.  We have basic extended cable service only giving us 780 dpi.  The HD is excellent and the analog picture is very good.  We have not explored the Internet to any extent, but seems to offer a large selection.  The one button Netflix access makes my wife very happy when the grandchildren visit.
