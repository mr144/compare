Picture is good, not as good as the Sony LCD TV it replaces tho. This TV claims to be an Internet TV -- comes with a USB plug in interface that is difficult to hook up, fails intermittently, has a poor NetFlix home screen and basically does not work. Had a similar problem with my Sony Blue Ray DVD player internet interface so went to a NetGear NeoTV Streaming Player, which I just hooked up to this new Sony TV, works fine....So, keep your old TV if it has a good pic, keep your current NetFlix hookup and good luck...News flash; TV stopped functioning, have asked Amazon how to return, awaiting answer.....
