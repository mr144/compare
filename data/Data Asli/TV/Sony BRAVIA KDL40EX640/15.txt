The Amazon process was excellent, great service good delivery.But Sony ....what a problem!The video apps for streaming have disappeared.  This is because Sony thinks my IP address is outside the USA.  Nope I checked I am still in Michigan, Toto.I have Satellite Internet and by law they must change the IP address on a regular basis.  Sony uses Ip2location to determine where I am, they can not find me therefore no streaming video.Spent 30 minutes on the phone with Viasat - not their issue - call SonySpent 60 minutes so far on the phone with Sony and escalated three time, no resolutionBottom line if you want streaming video do not buy Sony productsI can still stream on my Kindle Fire HD hooked on to the same satellite modem
