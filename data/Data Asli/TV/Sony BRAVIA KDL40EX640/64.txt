Purchased this TV because it was one of a few TVs which perfectly mount into my built-in, but it was the only TV with variable volume output to speaker system.  This means the volume on the TV remote can control the volume of external speakers.I am very pleased with the picture, features, and user interface for internet applications.  I would recommend for most applications.The only negative is the power-on startup is very slow (20-30 seconds).
