Ok, I will admit I did not buy it from Amazon.  I checked out a local retailer who had one and only one in stock at $1099 and could not pass it up.  My apologies to Amazon (who I regularly buy from).Regardless, took it hope pluged it in, fought with the aspect ratio (HDTV vs SAT TV receiver) for 2 hours and then finally found 'it'.  Ok, how does it perform?  I am shocked.  The HDTV content off of satellite is amazing.  At the local retailer I could have bought 23 different units, Panasonic, LG, Samsung... including those costing $500-1200 more, but the picture on the Sony had  didepth'.  That's the only way I can describe it.  This is not 3D, rather, excellent quality in 2D.  A face looks like a face, not a flat simulation.  It's different, it is real, it is not flat and washed out.  The picture is superior, period.Oh, audio, no issues there either.  Not amazin' but very adequate.Video on standard is great.  On 'vivid' I have to watch a baseball game and remind myself not to duck when the ball comes my way.  This is NOT a super high end unit.  But in the $1100-1700 range it is a great buy at $1099-1300.  No regrets.Now I have to upgrade some other components so, yes Amazon, I will buy from you (again).
