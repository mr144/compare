This tv is the best I could find.  The picture is lie you are where it is. set up was a walk in the park easy. The only thing I will say is the text in the  manual is to darn small fro eyes  like these. Make it bigger. I used the web site sony support and that was great help.  Bad thig was took longer to read it all.. Theres a site on you tube called s Sony listens that has a ton of info on it used that a lot. I may never use all that this TV does but it does have it if I can learn how to use it.Maybe someday  Lee
