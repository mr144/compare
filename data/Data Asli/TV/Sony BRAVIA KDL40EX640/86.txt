The TV after couple of months creating some siren sort of noises and one fine day there are some problems with the display.The 30 days warranty by the seller is over! Sony does not directly evaluate the problem they ask me to contact Sears to schedule the appointment.Sears charges $105 just to come and verify if there is any physical damage or not.The is no other option as the evaluation is a must for Sony and that too is scheduled by an external agency. Never expected this kind of support from Sony.There is no visible physical damage from outside and I am yet to hear back from Sears about the problem!
