This is for the 40' version. I really love this TV, it is perfect size for the room it is in and it is crystal clear.One problem, it allows for 'HDMI Control' and I have read around that it works with the ps3. I can not get it to work. Both the software on the TV and ps3 are up to date and I have tried multiple cables on each different HDMI port. Whenever I try to 'enable' in the HDMI setting 'Device list', it says 'no devices found'.So is the ps3 capable of it, from what I have read, or is it a lie?
