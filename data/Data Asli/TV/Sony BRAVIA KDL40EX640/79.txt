It is a nice tv. But nothing real special.  The only reason I purchased it is because I needed a 40' and Sony and Samsung are about the only mfr. that makes a 40'.  I always buy sony so i bought this one.  I only have one complaint and that is occasionally when i turn it on I get no sound.  If I turn in off and on again the sound returns.  Not a big deal but a bit annoying cause it takes a bit of time for it to come on.  My only concern is that the sound might go out altogether some time in the future...of course past the warranty date.  Sony support said it might be a faulty cable box so i am going to switch the cable box.If you are thinking about purchasing this tv, do not hesitate because of my problem.  I have read many reviews and I seem to be the only one having this problem...so lets hope it is a faulty cable box.
