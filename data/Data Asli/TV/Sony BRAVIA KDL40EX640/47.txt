Using this tv for 6 months now. I purchased it for lot higher than what it is priced now. Display is crystal clear with rich color. Movies look amazing. Internet portion is good but not the best. All I am worried is live tv apps and you tube, they both work perfect so do not have any complaints on the internet portion. Speaker produce loud and clear sound.Overall, we are very happy with the product.
