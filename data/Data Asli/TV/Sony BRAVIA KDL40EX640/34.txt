Tv looks fantastic! Had a Samsung and traded it in for this becauseI noticed the color was off on all my favorite movies (this wasafter adjusting EVERYTHING that could be adjusted).I always loved my parents' Sony, and now I know why.MUCH better picture and 1 BILLION more colors than Samsung!(Trust me--you can tell).VERY HAPPY with my Sony!
