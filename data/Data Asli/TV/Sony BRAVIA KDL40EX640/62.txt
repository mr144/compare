WARNING...DO NOT BUY A SONY PRODUCT. YOU WILL GET RIPPED OFF. I bought a Sony Bravia KDL-46W4100 four (4) years ago; paid $1998.50. It now needs an LCD Panel. Sony says the panel is no longer available. They will sell me a refurbished TV for $579.00 plus tax and I have to ship them my TV. I say after paying that much for a TV and not being able to get the part to fix it, they should replace it without charge. They said, 'NO.' Now I have a $1998.50 piece of crap!
