Years ago, Sony was the brand for televisions but not these days. Sony has fallen to near bottom. Their prices continue to be high but the products lack features and what features there are seem to be outdated. For example, this model needs their wi fi adapter in order to connect to the internet when other less expensive brands have it built in. In addition, Sony's adapter does not work very well and is more of a hassle than it is worth. Another problem I have with Sony is that I had purchased their earlier model 46EX620 about a year ago. In less than a year, it no longer can provide the TV listings via off the air antenna. Their so called 'Rovi Screen Guide' will now only work if you BUY Sony's wifi adapter for about $100 and hope it can connect to the internet. So for all those out there that still just use off the air antenna signals and do not want to connect to the internet, the TV Screen Guide is no longer available on the Sony. Funny thing is that I have a 13 inch Vizio that provides me with a full TV Listing Screen Guide. Finally, has anyone called Sony's customer service department? They are totally useless. Their reps have no idea about their products. Its sad that Sony is no longer the company it once was.
