This is our second Sony Bravia... it was an easy choice based on our good experience with a smaller version purchased 3 years ago. Perfect right out of the box, easy network setup, good picture and sound (not sure about negative reviews on this... if we turn the volume up much past the halfway point, it blasts us out of the room). And I love that the remote has a special 'netflix' button!
