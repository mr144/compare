I was very excited to have ordered this TV. First thing is shipping, I ordered this TV for next day shipping and  the day that it was supposed to arrive I was glued to the front door. After waiting for the bell to ring I tracked the package in UPS to find out that supposedly the driver made an attempt at 7:31 PM which is not true. I put a complaint with UPS and they said they will contact me first thing in the morning. Yeah right, Im still waiting for that phone call. Way to go UPS. When I finally got my TV and set it up it, my first impression was that the TV looked beautiful. Picture quality is good, colors seems to be correct even without tweaking them, HD looks great and SD looks good. Sound is very loud for a bedroom so no complaints at all here. Now for the bad, I was dissapointed when I turned off the lights to watch a movie at night and saw how terrible the corners light up like flashlights from all four corners. In some of the corners,the light reached the middle of the screen and in any dark scene you can notice those lights. I tried adjusting brightness and backlight, light sensor, Eco settings and nothing helped. Also the patches of light (Clouding) scattered around the screen are noticeable on dark scenes. I know that these issues may be present in LED TV's but on this set, it is very excessive.  Very bad screen uniformity in conclusion. To top it off, in the first week, the screen developed a stuck pixel. Colors deteriorate very fast when you move just a little from viewing head on. I think that Sony's quality control is absolutely absent. I think for Sony to be charging $900.00 and the screen having these types of problem when LED have been around for some time is unacceptable and to me personally, disrespectful. This TV is going back. I really hope Sony steps up their Quality control for their own good.
