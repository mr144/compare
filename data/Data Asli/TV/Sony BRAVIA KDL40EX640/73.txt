I did a lot of research leading up to this decision. I was originally leaning towards the 'top' brands that consumer reports and cnet were recommending. Those brands are Samsung, Panasonic, and LG.  To be fair, this Sony rated well with consumer reports, but you can not just go by reviews, one has to go see the t.v. on display at a store, and that's what I did. After 3 visits to a big electronics store and observing the various models for a long period of time, I was leaning towards the 40 inch Samsung. Right next to the Samsung I noticed a t.v. that had a great picture and much more natural and richer color. In fact, the colors were much better! It was this Sony. When the Samsung demo was showing human skin tones, they were just not right. One darker toned woman looked orange but on the Sony, her tones were just right! After watching for a while I noticed that all the colors represented by the Sony were much richer and more natural. I was pleasantly surprised. I also noticed that I never observed any motion blur on fast motion scenes like a football game. I also noticed that Sony's use of LED lighting was better than Samsung. The Samsung model made people look too pasty. I went home and looked at CR's take on this model and it was rated very well. They said it had an excellent hd picture. Out of the two brands, the sales associates said they would choose the Sony. I made my choice and bought this model. We absolutely love it! So glad I took my time and went and watched them in the store. Just got hd service and we are so happy with our decision! Let me remind you that Sony has been making t.v.'s for a long time and I am glad I chose them. Also, it is great to have Netflix stream right to the t.v.  Hope this helps.
