Awesome TV !!! (KDL-55EX640) Best picture I have ever seen!!! This TV replaced a Sony Rear Projection KDS-60A3000. The main reason for this purchase is it can be wall mounted. I am a No-Frills Default Kind of guy. I have 3 computers (2 Desks, 1-Lap) for the internet so I will probably never use this TV to access the internet. I also will never use the PIP/PAP function either. Also I do not care for 3-D because the glasses are to heavy and I already wear eye glasses. I really wish someone would make a flatscreen TV that you can choose your own options and features. The price could be determined by the amount of features you desire. My only regret is that this TV does not come in a 60 inch version. I have HD Programming from Directv and the HD images are absolutely stunning!!! I thought my previous Sony Rear Projection had a great picture. It pales in comparison.
