Well, I still by a TV to primarily watch TV programs.  With that said, I did find it easy to set up everything including Netflix and Internet access.  Great picture.  The net savings in buying through Amazon rather than a local big box  store was  approximately $140.  Since I am Amazon Prime, I got next day delivery.  Everything is good...product, price, shipping.
