Great picture - great sound (thought i might consider a small front speaker facing system though but not neccessary). Energy efficient 18 bucks for 12 months? Ca not beat that.The internet connection works well. Not much of a learning curve. Has another USB port to handle your music, pics and video. Impressive! I got rid of cable so am only using an indoor HD antenna that works incrediblievely well for free and well as Netflix with Roku or Smartsony for 8 bucks a month. I do not really miss the cable for which I was spending well over 100 bucks a month. What a rip. I can see why people are &#34;cutting the cord&#34;. Do not think it can not be do not without much inconvevience.Paul
