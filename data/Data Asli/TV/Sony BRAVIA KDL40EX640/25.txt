What can i say about sony.First I have Sony 40' LCD Tv then i sold and was shopping for 55&#34;I bought Samsung then Panasonic but there is no comparison of this Sony with other brands incl Samsung.Screen is great.Functions are good i am using all setting that came with it.I purchased this from amazon warehouse deal used good condition but honestly box was ok condition but TV was almost brand new like someone returned within 30 days. The plastic covers was there on TV and stands. Manuals, remote and screw was in sealed package.I am buying square trade warranty since this will have no warranty from Sony and square trade is selling specially for warehouse open box item only for $44.95 for a year and hope do not have use that warranty.My first Sony 40&#34; LCD TV i bought in 2009 for $600 and then i sold in 2012 Feb after 3 years for $350 on craigslist. People go crazy for Sony brand like me.About speaker is good but not so great but even $3000 TV will have same quality of speaker.
