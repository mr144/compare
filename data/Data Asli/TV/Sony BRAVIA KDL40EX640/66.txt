This is a great value for my situation. Since I run the sound through a quality home theater setup, I am not bothered by the poor sound described by some reviewers. The picture is beautiful and I do not seem to have any issues with either the aspect ratio or glare mentioned in other reviews. Finally, I have been using Apple TV since its introduction, so I am not inconvenienced by my inability to get the Sony's network functions running.
