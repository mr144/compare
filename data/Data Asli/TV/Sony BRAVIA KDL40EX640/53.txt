Just purchased a SONY BRAVIA  46EX641 .. it was easy to get the WiFi going but the rest went down hill.The remote has a NETFLIX (main reason we purchased it) but there is no way to get NETFLIX with SONY in Costa Rica.  Also the box shows all these APPS/MOVIES/MUSIC which you do not get... You have to purchase 'Sony Essentials' for $60 a year to get the bundle.....  We are definitely returning this....
