My Sony Bravia lasted 18 months before it started blacking out and needed to be turned off and back on in order to reset the picture.Sony 'offered' to replace their faulty TV with a  arefurbished' model for $600 + tax.I do not think so - try other brands - you will not get much sympathy from 'Sony customer support'.Disappointed that I paid $1200 and only got 18 months of use out of it - in fact, I am still paying on it for another 6 months.Sony used to have great and reliable products - now what?
