Was happy to get the KDL55EX640 today. But turned to very disappointment after set up.Problem:It's little bit foggy on the picture.Picture is not nature color.Tried to adjust settings without success.HUE is in grey column and unable to be adjusted. Sony tech support on chatting suggested to power off tv and unplug outlet, plug it back and turn on tv after 60 seconds to see if HUE can be working.Also, a more serious issue is we felt dizzy when we watch the tv program. This is a very unusal experience. A friend complained the same and said it takes few days to get used to it.Per tech support, try to power off reset.This tv has no comparison with the other one 52' I bought 3 years ago.Will return it.By the way, whyAmzon mixed all the reviews of different sizes tv of EX640 together and presented average 4 stars for this tv?It mislead people reading it.
