The picture quality on this TV was as good or better than the next up Sony TV we saw in the store, and for a lower price. Considering that it does not have local dimming, the blacks are pretty dark, and we have not noticed any areas where the backlight shines through unevenly. There are also settings that allow you to set it so that it does not look like you are watching a jittery soap opera (as in the early 120 Hz LCD TVs). The sound is not that great out of the tiny speakers, so I took a star off for that, but we run it through the stereo receiver so it does not matter to us. All in all, we are happy with it.
