I bought this TV in 2009 after seeing a deal online during November.  It was a our first large flat-screen HDTV purchase and I have never regretted it!  The picture, while it does not have that 'live' feeling (which I do not like by the way), is very good.  The lighting from the set is great.  We love the 'internet' capability.  The only thing we wish it had was 3D!  We have had one issue, on occasion the sound will disappear after changing HDMI inputs.  We turn the TV off and then back on and sound is restored.  This is the only reason for not giving it 5 stars.  I highly recommend.
