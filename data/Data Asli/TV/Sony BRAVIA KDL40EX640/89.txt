Received this HDTV today and after easy setup watched Terminator 2. The picture was crystal clear with no motion blur. Received a free blu-ray player as an added bonus. This TV was selling for $1600 by all the stores I looked up. An extra $300 gets you 240Hz refresh rate vs 120Hz. An extra $800 gets you SONY's high end HDTV with Gorilla Glass. The 55 inch size is perfect - not too big and not too small.
