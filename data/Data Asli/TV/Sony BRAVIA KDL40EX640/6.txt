This item replaces my prior Sony LCD Tv due to theft.  The picture on the LED is brilliant and setup was fairly easy.  I just received the product today and still trying to setup my wireless network to the tv due to having a pass key which is case sensitive and not sure how to key in it properly through the remote, but sure I will figure that out once I have had a little more time.  I would recommend this product and buying from Amazon.  The shipping was fast and the product was very well packed to protect.
