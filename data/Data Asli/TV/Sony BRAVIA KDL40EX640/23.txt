This is a great HDTV that has awesome picture quality and is thin and stylish.  Unfortunately the sound is sub-par and requires additional purchases (for me) to correct.  So, if you already have a sound system and are just needing to plug in a new tv, this could be a good one.  By price ($600-$700) it is pretty close to a 3d system so maybe one of those would be a better option?
