I bought this tv when a local store had them on sale, after deciding to get an internet tv.  I am by no means an expert, but I have been impressed by this tv.  The visuals are very clear, even for non-HD channels, and the sound comes through just as good even without the aid of any additional speaker systems.  Set-up was easy, the internet interface is not difficult to figure out nor was it hard to set up new accounts to different sites or download new apps.  The remote helps to navigate the web as well, with an actual keyboard. It's great to have everything on one television and not have to worry about having other devices if you do want to connect to your Netflix, Hulu, etc account.The one complaint I do have is not about the tv but the lack of instructions. You can go to the Sony site, but it would have been nice to have more info WITH the tv.
