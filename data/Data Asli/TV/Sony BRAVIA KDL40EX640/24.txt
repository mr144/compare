After looking at several TVs, my wife and I thought the picture quality is one of the best. It hooks up easily to Netflix, as well as internet TV. With this, we are considering getting rid of cable and just access internet tv and local on the air stations, all in HD. I subtracted one star for audio, it is not that great, may consider a small sound system for this TV since it will be in our bedroom.
