The TV is great just as other reviewers claimed.  I was pleasently surprised how good the audio is on this LED TV.  Normally the thin case of LED TV's do not allow enough room for decent speakers. The bottom of this TV bulges out a little to make room for its bigger speakers.  So I saved some money on buying a sound bar.Based on Amazon comparison chart, I thought this TV supported Skype so I spent another $100 bucks to buy the Sony Skype camera and microphone unit.  After many failed attempts to get it to work with the TV, I called Sony only to find out that the TV does not support Skype. I looked the TV up on the Sony website and there was no mention of Skype support.
