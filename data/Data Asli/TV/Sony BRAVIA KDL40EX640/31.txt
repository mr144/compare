Good tv when screens all black you caan see light spots around the corners the most looks smoky almost but it kicks the s*** out of my like 93 model sony lol so I could not be happier for the money I doubt you can beat it for a ps3 player it links right up and I can use the tv remote to do things on my ps3 its so worth it
