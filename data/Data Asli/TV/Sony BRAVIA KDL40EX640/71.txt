Video, very nice, audio, very poor, web interface, frustrating and clunky.  You have to type by using an on screen alpha numerical layout which you select by using up down left and right.  Navigating web pages is done by the same controls and it is very inaccurate.  The picture is amazing but all other functionality is not good. I will fix the audio with a sound bar but will likely never use the Internet because it is so poorly done.
