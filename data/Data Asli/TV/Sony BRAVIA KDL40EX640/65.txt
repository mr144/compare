We owned an older model 32-Inch Sharp TV and although it still works, we decided to replace it with a HD Color TV.  After much research, reviewing Consumer Reports, and taking my son's recommendation (he really likes his Sony Bravia) I decided to check out Amazon.com's reviews on the Bravia and after reading many reviews on all screen sizes, I clicked on BUY for the Sony Bravia 40EX640 40-Inch 1080p.  It was packaged very well, all accessories and screws were accounted for and in good condition.  We are using this TV strictly as a TV and to play our collection of movies in DVD and Blue Ray formats, so I cannot offer an opinion about the Internet and other options.  What I can say is that it was easy to assemble, set up, and after a few adjustments...what a beautiful picture!  I had printed out an info sheet from another web site on how to calibrate a Sony Bravia and mostly made my personal adjustments from those instructions that actually were not too extreme from the Sony Bravia default options.Although the TV speaker sound passes as we have never had external audio enhancers, I did order the Sony Sound Bar for TV's 40-inches and higher.  It will arrive today and I am looking forward to comparing the difference.  My husband has a hearing problem so maybe he can quit using the TV Ears which will make him very happy.We look forward to many years of entertainment from this TV and if there are any updates due to problems or otherwise, I will submit them at a later time.
