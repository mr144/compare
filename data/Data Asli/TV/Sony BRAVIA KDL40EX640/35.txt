The TV meets my expectations for picture quality and internet connectivity, but I can not say that it really exceeds them, so I would have given it 4 stars if it were not for one audio problem I have encountered.I am using the TV's optical (toslink) output to connect to my stereo receiver since I, like another reviewer, prefer good stereo sound to the clutter of 5 or more speakers in a typical home theater configuration.Unfortunately, the TV toslink to stereo receiver configuration does not work for all sound sources, especially Dolby 5.1 streamed by Netflix and Amazon. Videos with HE-AAC sound work OK, but those with Dolby 5.1 sound are silent. There are various workarounds (I have consulted both Sony and Amazon Instant Video support), but the problem could have been avoided if Sony had simply included a  didownmix to stereo' feature (as is commonly found on Blu-ray players) for the TV's optical output.This deficiency probably will not affect many people, but it did affect me.
