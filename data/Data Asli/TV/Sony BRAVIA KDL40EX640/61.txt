We do not have HD input yet so this Sony was our choice for the best picture quality while not using hd.  This is our 3rd Sony tv & we are quite happy with the quality of Sony.  It's being used in a small room and no sound bar is needed - the sound is clear, plenty loud and good quality.  We are quite happy with our purchase although if we had waited one more week we could have saved $30 on it but oh well!
