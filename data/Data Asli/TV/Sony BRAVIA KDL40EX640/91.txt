Bought this TV brand new from one of the Best Buy closing out sales. I must say I am shocked at how everyone seems to be having so many problems with getting Netflix to work on this TV. I got Netflix up and running immediately along with the Hulu. This televisions contrast ratio is amazing, you can always tell a difference between the colors, especially the dark scenes vesus the very light scenes. Definitely has a clear image and is really great for gaming. I have to say that I did not appreciate the fact that it has Yahoo! apps built in versus Google apps. I do absolutely like the Bravia sync, as it works really well with other Sony devices, the remote is interchangeable between all items and thats really helpful. Overall, really great product and I am once again impressed with Sony screens.
