This TV has the best picture I have ever seen. The image intensity is outstanding and colors are vibrant. Netflix feature is very convenient also.The TV is very thin so I was able to use a low profile support and it looks great on the wall of my bedroom.On the other hand, I would prefer that I/O were on the side of the TV. If you use a low profile support like mine, you'll find that connectors must be bent sharply to fit the small gap left between TV and wall.I did like to mention that SONY tech support is awesome, I had to call them for a minor problem, not related to the TV (NETFLIX was not available for some hours) and they were really receptive and helpful.Bottomline, this is the best TV I have ever had. I highly recommend it..........................Este TV tiene la mejor imagen que yo haya visto jamas, los colores son n&iacute;tidos y la calidad parece de Blu-ray.Es un TV delgado asi que se puede usar un soporte de bajo perfil para colgarlo en la pared, si bien las entradas deber&iacute;an estar en un lado y no detr&aacute;s, lo que hace que haya que doblar los cables para que quepan entre el TV y la pared.El servicio a clientes de SONY tambi&eacute;n es excelente  .Recomiendo ampliamante este TV.
