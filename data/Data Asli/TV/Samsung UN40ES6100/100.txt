I have tried adjusting my tv to have it display in HD while watching Netflix through the SmartHub (which is amazing!!!). Problem is, the HD Netflix movies and shows are not coming through the TV as HD. They are pixely and look like a standard definition movie. The Clear Motion also does not seem smooth like what I was shown in the store. Will be taking the tv back, as it very well may be a defect.
