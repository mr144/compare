Love the TV. Smart TV that does the job. Takes some time to load contents, and yes, it is harder to type up the titles to search on Youtube, but this is not a computer. TV that does some things that computers do is great and is what we were looking for. Yes, it shows a little too real or too vivid, but we just set it at Movie mode and it took care for the most part. Very happy with the purchase and will highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy a solid smart TV.Since there's no separate section to review the delivery service, here it goes..It seems to be delivered by local delivery company. They set up a date with you and come within the timeframe. HOWEVER, only 1 person showed up instead of 2 people as promised. So what happens? This one guy drags the TV box across the driveway - I wanted to tell him to carry it instead of dragging it since it is worth a grand, but did not have guts to. After he drags it into the house, he needs to plug it into an electrical outlet and test it out - BUT they cannot assemble the stand. So what happens? I have to help him take it out of the box and hold it up for him, so he can test it out. I felt like I did almost the half of the work but tipped him anyway. Amazon, this delivery company I would not recommend, I have seen better delivery services, so please switch them out.
