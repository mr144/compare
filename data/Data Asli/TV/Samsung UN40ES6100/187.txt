I have been a samsung lover for the past 7 years.  I started with a rear-projection tv and when I go to other people's houses I always am pleased with my samsungs.  I purchased a plasma 51&#34; a year ago and always wanted one of these smart tv's when I started seeing them on samsung's website.  I purchased this to update the bedroom and the picture is the best I have ever seen.
