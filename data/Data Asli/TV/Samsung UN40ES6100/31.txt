We have had this for over a year now and we still enjoy its picture quality every day.  The audio from the TV is ok but for true stereo with a deep bass and all the bells and whistles we have it connected to our home stereo A/V receiver.  When we watch a movie now it IS like being in a movie theatre.  It took 10 minutes to have it connected wirelessly to our home router and we enjoy Netflix and online content.  It is super thin and light ours is on an old tv stand which is 60 inches wide. Be careful around it and bumping into it.  One day we want to wall mount it.  Shipping was ok.  It was freighted by a non traditional company and when I discovered it would take additional time to be delivered to me door from a local airport warehouse location I opted to drive my SUV to pick it up.  It was bulky not heavy and my teen age son helped me load and unload and set it up.  The energy saving feature and the actual amount of electricity this tv dropped our electric bill about $20 per month.  We replaced an older Sony LCD big screen tv and were amazed at home much our electric bill dropped.  This TV is viewed an average of 6 or 7 hours a day with my TV addicted husband enjoying the picture quality.
