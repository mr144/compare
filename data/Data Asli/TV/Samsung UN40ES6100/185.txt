I purchased two Samsung HDTVs (11/19/12).  One being a 60 inch and the second being 46 inch.I hired  professional sound men to install the units with all new home theater equipment.  When the box of the 60 inch unit was opened there was an omission of a power chord and product comptroller.  I called the amazon representative with no resolution.  He advised me to call 1-800-726-7864 (800-SAM-SUNG).  The Sam Sung representative stated that I would have to purchase the power cord and controller unit from J and J Parts (800-627-4368).I am against purchasing another unit secondary to a manufacturer error.  I will decline their request.
