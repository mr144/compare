I was skeptical about the usability of the wi-fii but I love it and would not have another tv for main use without it.  There is no blur in viewing so I am a fan of the refresh speed and while the picture is very good, it is just not jaw dropping for me.  Still a very good tv and I do not know of another one with a better picture I need to trade up for.
