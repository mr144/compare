I have a lot of experience doing color correction of digital images, so FWIW, I know what bad color looks like when I see it.I just set up a Samsung UN40ES6100, and I immediately saw plenty of that.The default Samsung UN40ES6100 picture quality settings are pretty awful.The basic problem is that the default settings have too much contrast, brightness and color saturation.They produce a picture that seems  intended to 'pop' in the store, but is actually very unrealistic, un-natural, almost cartoonish.There are many examples of this, but perhaps the best is that grass (e.g.: football field) is far too unrealistically bright glowing (almost fluorescent) green than it should be.Samsung could easily have done better.The default Picture Mode setting on the UN40ES6100 I just set up was 'Standard' (the other three choices are  'Dynamic,' 'Natural' and 'Movie'). There are also a looooot of additional settings (especially in the Advanced Settings) that allow changes to be made to many different attributes that affect the picture color and quality. Most of which are available only if the Picture Mode is set to one of the other choices besides 'Dynamic' or 'Natural.'Unless you want to spend hours tweaking all those settings, I suggest changing Picture Mode to 'Dynamic' or 'Natural' even though that will cause the Advanced Settings to be unavailable, because it will also make fine tuning a lot simpler. One reason for this is that changes to many of the advanced settings are inter-related; changing one causes changes to other aspects of picture quality.  This can turn the process of dialing in the correct image quality using the advanced settings into a time consuming struggle. You can still to get excellent image quality with Picture Mode set to 'Dynamic' or 'Natural.'The 'Dynamic' Picture Mode appears to have artificial dynamic contrast expansion on the quarter-tone to three quarter-tone range (the middle part of the contrast range, e.g.: maybe the 30%-to-70% range is expanded out to maybe 20%-to-80%), at the expense of shadow and highlight detail (e.g.: the 0%-to-30% brightness range is compressed to 0%-to-20% and the 70%-to-100% brightness range is compressed to 80%-to-100%), to make the image have a more 'punchy' look. This dynamic aspect of this range expansion is that it appears to vary somewhat depending on the image on screen at any given time. Sometimes this causes very slight, but noticeable shifts in the image brightness. In comparison, the 'Natural' Picture Mode does not appear to have this contrast adjustment, so compared to 'Dynamic' it looks more natural, less punchy, with slightly better highlight detail and noticeably better shadow detail.In all four 'Picture Modes' the default Picture options: 'Color Tone' setting is 'Cool' and I am pretty sure that is wrong for just about every situation.  Color Tone: 'Cool' makes whites a little too blue and also introduces a greenish/bluish color cast to highlight & shadow areas that should be close to neutral (e.g.: causes a greenish color cast in men's beard stubble). Color Tone: 'Cool' also causes grass (e.g.: football field) to be even more unrealistically bright glowing green than it should be. It should be changed to 'Standard.' The other two choices (Warm 1 and Warm 2) are not available with Picture Mode set to 'Dynamic' and are probably undesirable anyway, because Warm 1 and Warm 2 introduce a noticeable color cast into what should be neutral highlights (unless compensated for in white balance; an example of how changing one advanced setting affects something else).- - - - - - - - - -So the easiest way to make the Samsung UN40ES6100 look a lot better and more realistic is use either of the following settings as a starting point:Picture Mode: DynamicBacklight: 15 or less (Reduces backlight bleed-thru 'clouds.' Lower backlight setting may require slightly higher brightness)Contrast: 70 to 80 (default is 100. Helps compensate for 'Dynamic' Picture Mode's artificially expanded mid-tone contrast)Brightness: 35 to 40Sharpness: 35 to 45  (default is 55. Depends on personal preference; sharper picture = more noticeable sharpening artifacts)Color: 35 to 45 (closer to 35 is more natural, but some people like over-saturated colors)Tint: should be within 2 of the default 50-50 setting; e.g.: 48-52 or 52-48Picture options-> Color Tone: StandardPicture Mode: NaturalBacklight: 15 or lessContrast: 95 to 100 (definitely requires a higher setting than the 'Dynamic' Picture Mode)Brightness: 45Sharpness: 35 to 45Color: 40 to 45Tint: should be within 2 of the default 50-50 setting; e.g.: 48-52 or 52-48Picture options-> Color Tone: StandardIn summary, either of these two setups should give a pretty good result:Set Picture Mode to Dynamic; significantly reduce backlight, contrast, brightness, sharpness & color saturation; set Color Tone to StandardorSet Picture Mode to Natural; significantly reduce backlight, brightness, sharpness & color saturation; set Color Tone to StandardAlso, the 'ECO' settings (System->'Eco Solution') should be turned off, because they cause the screen routinely change brightness when it should not, with the net result being that it looks like flickering.- - - - - - - - - -These settings should get you pretty close to having an excellent - but realistic looking - picture quality, especially for Over The Air HDTV signals. I had to use slightly different settings for the HDMI signal coming from my HTPC DVR (which itself has an even more extensive set of image adjustments available in the video card software). When you throw in the adjustments that are possible on each other device that sends a signal to the TV set (which itself has independent settings for each input and signal type), it is easy to see why the overall complexity increases very quickly.If possible, I did start with the most consistent possible source - an OTA HDTV signal, and I did use the live local HDTV news broadcast as the guide, because they seem to have the best control over lighting in their studios and the signal is live.It is also important to note that these video quality settings are tied EACH video input and/or signal type.  This means that not only will settings made for HDMI1  *NOT* automatically apply to any the other input (i.e.: you have to repeat the adjustment process for EACH and every input), but also if you are using the antenna connection, the settings can be different for each different signal type as well (HDTV, SDTV, analog, etc.), and this also applies to aspect ratio control - which is a good thing, because it allows different picture quality and aspect ratio settings for each different signal type coming in via the same antenna connection. The settings for SmartHub/Netflix/HuluPlus, etc. are also different too, so you need to check the values for each app you use.- - - - - - - - - -After setting up the new Samsung 6100 TV set, I had to re-configure my home theater audio system. Normally, I would have used an external powered woofer/subwoofer, and let the TV's internal speakers take care of the mid-range and treble, but there's a problem in this case:The Samsung 6100 external audio output is fixed volume, which means the internal volume control does not affect the volume of the external audio output.Not only that, none of the other audio adjustments (including the 6100's equalizer, sound effects, and 'Automatic Volume' volume leveler) are applied to the external audio output either. Since the internal speakers are wimpy, and even worse, down-firing (which makes them muffled), I had to disable them entirely and use only an external speaker system.I can not believe that Samsung did not provide a setting to make the external audio output variable with the TV's volume setting, especially considering that would be a fairly standard way for some people who do not have elaborate sound systems to improve upon the dinky internal speakers, and also considering that competing products like the Vizio M420SL provide a setting to make the external audio volume change with the TV's volume setting.
