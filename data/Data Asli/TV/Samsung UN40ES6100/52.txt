I love the slim design and the crystal-clear picture of this TV. I would have given it 5 stars if it was not for the premium price for the Smart TV feature, which I had a lot of problems with and had to frequently reload the firmware. I also could not get the iPhone app to work 100% correctly with it, thus the 4-star rating.
