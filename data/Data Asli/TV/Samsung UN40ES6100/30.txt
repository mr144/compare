I bought this TV in December 2012 and the Smart Hub worked fine for the first month or so and it went downhill after that. Ca not use Amazon or Netflix. Wasted tons of time with Samsung customer service who kept promising that a fix is on the way but nothing has been done to this date. Did all updates and resettings but nothing will work, so I am very disappointed by this lemon of a product. Called Netflix and Amazon and they blamed the problem squarely on Samsung. I have other devices in the house that stream Amazon and Netflix without any problem so it makes sense that Netflix and Amazon are saying this is not their problem. Anyway, only reason I bought this model in the first place was for the Smart TV feature but since that has now failed to work, I feel like this has been a complete waste of serious money. If Smart TV is important to you, please do your investigation first before buying this product. Otherwise, this product is a total junk as far as I am concerned.
