I bought a Samsung tv in 2008 for over $3,000 which has since become a paper weight because Samsung REFUSES to support it product.  It has taken a class action law suit  to receive any customer service from this company and the lawsuit was so narrow that it missed an additional issue that thousands of the affected tv's were beset with:  faulty mainboards.  This company is terrible and should be shut out of the US market for selling junk.  DO NOT BUY THEIR PRODUCTS!!
