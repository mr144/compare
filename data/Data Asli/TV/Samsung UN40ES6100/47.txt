I called Samsung Tech support 3/30/13 to ask for help on a software update for my 55 inch LED TV.  They demanded I pay $99 before they would either (1) give me instructions on the download or (2) give me instructions to delete the download message from my TV screen. What a rip off.  I should also mention that I waited on hold for 49 minutes to hear this information!What I was *not* told was that I could find clear instructions on the download at the Samsung website. (which is what I did) It would have been so much easier for them to tell me to go to the website, rather than create an angry consumer.  Shame on you, Samsung.
