I was able to watch  a single movie using amazon instant video on Smarthub. Next thing I know is I needed to updated the device firmware, which I did. After that, I lost most of the apps that were already downloaded. I re-downloaded amazon instant videos, but it does not work anymore. When I click on the instant video icon, the device freezes, does not actually run anything, and thirty minutes or so later, I have to turn it off and on again in order to get out of smarthub.
