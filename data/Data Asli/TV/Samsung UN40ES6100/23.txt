This tv is beautiful, and I am very happy with the picture quality and extremely slim design, and ease to setup.HOWEVER - beware purchasing from Amazon Warehouse Deals, even 'like new'. Mine was supposedly in like new condition, it arrived with no protection on one side of the tv, and significant damage to the plastic casing at the front and large scratches on the back, which will affect it is resale value if I ever move (and annoy me every time I look at the broken plastic on the front). It's probably worth shelling out the extra couple of hundred bucks to get a new TV. I am pretty sure at least the damage to the plastic casing was a result of poor packaging. I have been emailing and on the phone with Amazon trying to get a discount (update: they gave me a 20% discount, which was nice!), but it is still disappointing to have to see the broken plastic every day. That plus the amount of time wrangling a refund basically means I should have bought a new tv in the first place :(
