My brother in law bought this TV a couple months ago and I saw it at Thanksgiving and said WOW - my wife asked if we could get one.  First big order through Amazon and it arrived in a few days after the order.  TV is awesome.  Stream Netflix daily with NO / ZERO issues (I have TimeWarner high speed and a high end Cisco router).  My wife likes the built in yoga sessions.  The quality is so good it almost looks 3D without it being 3D.  It puts my 42&#34; LCD (that is about 3 years old) to shame.
