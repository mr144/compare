I have only had the television a month and I do not watch it daily ,but so far so good.As other reviewers have mentioned the hub is weak,but I have enjoyed the tv so far.I have not got my settings the way I want them,so once I get them set I can offer a more detailed review. I followed the settings some other reviewers gave,but they did not work for me.So I will continue to tweak until I have a better picture.If anyone has this particular set I am willing to listen.
