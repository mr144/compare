Got this TV on sale when it was $1499 (the cheapest it seems to go down) and I have been very happy with it.The &#34;Smart&#34; functions are user-friendly and respond quickly and the TV has a very sleek, thin design. I bought the this Smart TV version because I read better reviews than its &#34;Dumb TV&#34; equivalent but I find myself using the features all the time. Streaming Netflix and HBO go without using my Xbox is awesome.The video quality is great as !!!***as long as the source of the video is good***!!! Some channels have stronger HD than others and that's where I think the criticism comes from. Channels like AMC, ESPN, HBO, etc look fantastic. Something on your local CW may not look as good.As mentioned by many others, the biggest issue with this TV is the sound. You have really got to crank up the volume to get decent audio in the room. I plan to buy a sound bar, which will hopefully solve this.If you are looking for a somewhat cheap HD TV and do not care about 3D, this is a good buy.
