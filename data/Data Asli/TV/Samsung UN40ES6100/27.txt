UPDATED!!!!!!!  These TV's are GARBAGE! If you read my initial review i wrote it after i got one defective TV and figured a lemon is always possible, but the replacement was also defective...this time instead of the picture sometimes not coming on, the picture came on but when it first started up there were green lines all over the screen like on an old green screen apple computer when a game would not load right.  Stay away from this TV...Amazon still took care of my needs as a customer but the particular model of TV seems to have serious flaws.I got my TV very quickly and was excited to set it up and see how it worked.  The very first time i tried to turn the tv on I got a black screen with a glow like the tv was on but no picture was showing up.  I turned the TV off and turned it back on and the samsung emblem popped up and then the picture came on.  I did not think to much of it until it happened the next time i tried to turn the TV on.  I then knew there was something wrong with the tv.  I called samsung on the help line, and they told me to update my firm ware for the tv, to which i told them that this was not a firm ware issue it clearly was something with the hardware.  I contacted amazon and told them the problem, and that when the tv worked the picture was fantastic and it worked well, again, when the picture came on.  I was on the phone with amazon about 3-5 minutes and they shipped out a new replacement tv for me without any hassle.  This is why i gave the product a 4 star rating, because the first one I got was not working correctly but the customer service from amazon is why i would recommend buying this TV, as it does have a great picture and is a good price, and if you DO have problems as can happen with any electronic device, amazon will take care of the customer.
