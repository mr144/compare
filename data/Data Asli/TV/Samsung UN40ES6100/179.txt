I upgraded to this from a 40&#34; LCD. My old tv was one of the original flatscreens that came out back in the day. I use mine as a monitor for my computer so all the apps are nice but i do not use them much. The picture is excellent. The TV itself is extremely light and thin. I have read reviews about how the apps take forever to load, i do not buy in to that crap. They load just fine, especially when compared to a Vizio's slow app processing power. Overall i would definitely buy this tv again and have suggested it to everyone i know in the market for a new tv. i paid 650 for mine so it was an excellent deal, especially since they range from 750+ during non seasonal sales.
