Already had a Samsung 46&#34; and wanted to move up.  This upgrade increased my viewing area by 43%.  Sharp, clear, and Smart-tv capability allows easy access to Netflix and others plus many other features I have not explored yet.  A great TV. The 55&#34; has an upgraded version with 3D capability; those who are gamers or with kids might enjoy this feature for a few dollars more.
