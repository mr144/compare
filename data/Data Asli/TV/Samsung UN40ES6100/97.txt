LOVE this TV! And Amazon customer service is the best.  The TV was damaged during shipment which I did not discover until setting it up however CS replaced it without a problem and I had my new, undamaged TV within days.  The TV itself is slim and fits nicely into the room.  The apps are great - I have logged into all my accounts and listen to Pandora, rent movies through Netflix, plus can access the Internet through wireless.  Oh and of course there's using it as a normal TV.  The picture quality's crisp and you are able to customize the settings to whatever works best for you.  I was also very happy with the deal I got right before the holiday season.
