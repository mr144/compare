Sorry - can not give you a highly technical review. Suffice it to say the picture quality is INCREDIBLE. Even those old 60s batman shows with Adam West look 'hi-def'. I struggled for a couple of weeks with the Smart TV function. After reviewing other Amazon reviews, I figured it was not my internet service or wireless connection but rather the Smart TV function was not quite up to par. I purchased a BluRay with WiFi, plugged it in with an HDMI cable and I was streaming video within 1/2 an hour via Amazon Prime. Incredible! Highly recommended for picture quality. Smart function is not so smart.
