This is a very nice small bezel TV with outstanding color, and high contrast.  I paid the incremental amount for the Smart TV features, but after using it I regret paying extra for the Smart TV and not just buying the less expensive version without the Smart features and putting that money toward another TiVo.  There is little that is of use to me in the Smart UI.
