This is a great TV, but its default picture settings are lacking, and many of the web pages claiming 'professionally calibrated' settings really only work for low light movies.  After fiddling with the settings for many hours, these are what I would recommend.Picture Mode: StandardBacklight 15 (any higher and you get bleed through in black scenes)Contrast 75Brightness 45Sharpness 50 (others recommend 0-20, but I think 50 is best for HD)Color 50Tint G50/R50ADVANCE SETTINGSDynamic Contrast: High (this is key unless you want a washed out image)Black Tone DarkerFlesh Tone 0RGB Only Mode OffColor Space NativePICTURE OPTIONSColor Tone Warm1Digital Noise Filter AutoMPEG Noise Filter AutoFilm Mode OffAuto Motion Plus OffLED Motion Plus Off
