I was a little disappointed with the colors of the TV.  I obtained a calibration DVD, but it did not really improve the color that much.  I contacted  Samsung support and requested recommended settings.  They replied by telling me to read the manual.  I am still trying to get the colors adjusted to my liking.  This is the first TV I have purchased that has given me so much trouble to adjust its colors. Never again Samsung.  I do have to admit that the Wi-Fi is a very nice feature and easy to set up.
