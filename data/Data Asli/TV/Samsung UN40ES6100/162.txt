I found this TV at another store and purchased it on Christmas layaway on impulse because of the great sale price. After spending the next month reading reviews, I wondered if I had made a mistake considering some of the comments about connectivity issues and ease of use.I have to say this is one impulse I do not regret! The image resolution is beautiful! And, despite the mess that my cable tech made when switching my service from one company to another, I was connected to my cable service AND my home wireless network in under 15 minutes. I would place myself at maybe 6 or 7 on the techie scale of 1-10, yet set up was a snap.I mainly purchased this to watch Netflix movies without having to connect a separate computer. The Netflix app works beautifully! I was able to sign into my account and watch a movie within a matter of minutes. The You Tube app also works great. And the Fitness app is a bonus for both fitness buffs and beginners alike. Although the TV was not purchased for that reason, I consider the fitness app a lovely surprise extra!Right now, the TV is on a stand. I plan to do a wall mount later. I have read that some people have issues with the position and size of the power plug, but I am sure I will be able to find the appropriate mount that can accommodate the cord.Overall, I am very, very pleased with this product!
