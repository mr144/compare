I have no complaints about the TV, but I was obsessive before I purchased it whether or not the SmartTV functions would be worth it because you pay a premium for it. So far so good, but 100% of the time we are using either Amazon on Demand or Netflix, and both of them are available through TiVo as well as gaming devices.The picture quality of the TV is great. I wish the light on the remote would stay on longer.
