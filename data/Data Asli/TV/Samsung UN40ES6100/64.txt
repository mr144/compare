This 6100 appears to be a great looking TV, especially for the price. The main drawback of the Samsung smart TV has been finding a compatible keyboard since the remote that comes with the samsung UN40ES6100 would have you to enter information very slowly using a few motions to even add a character which is very frustrating. Writing an email could take hours! Well, after looking into what Samsung did NOT have to offer for the 6100 models I did some praying and research and actually found a combination Logitech K400 keyboard that has a very smooth and large mouse pad (page up and down work also :) ... at about 1/3 of the price that Samsung offers on their more expensive models that they do make compatible keyboards for. If you have a smart TV with a USB and are frustrated then check the Logitech K400 out, chances are you may be able to use this wireless keyboard also. I was able to pick it up at Wall Mart for under 40.00. Just turn on your TV, then pull the 2 tabs out to activate batteries on back of keyboard, plug in the small USB into the USB receiver (is a range extender) and plug the USB range extender into the USB port in back of your TV and you should be off and running. Enjoy!  John 3:16
