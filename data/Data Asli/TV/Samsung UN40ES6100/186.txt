I bought this TV on Black Friday expecting just an LED HDTV. What I got was more than I bargained for! This is a 3D LED TV that came with 2-free 3D Glasses that sync to the TV when you turn the glasses on. The WiFi works excellent and the picture quality is truly amazing. I have a 55&#34; LG LED TV, but this Samsung beats the picture quality of the LG. This is a great TV for the price. I would highly recommend!
