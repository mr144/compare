The TV arrived inside its box inside another box! Packed very well for shipping, arrived with no damage, delivered right into my living room! Unpacked and plugged it in and within an hour was up and running. I have connected an old Logitec wireless keyboard and mouse that I had, the TV recognized both and we were able to surf the web easily with the built in browser. Love this TV
