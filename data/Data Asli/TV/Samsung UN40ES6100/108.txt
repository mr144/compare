TV picture is excellent. Low power consumption for such a large screeen is amazing, and very sharp. LED colors are very good, although my prior 46&#34; Samsung LCD was slightly warmer colors that I did like. Excellent connections in back. Much lighter weight. Smaller boarders around the TV made it not look imposing. &#34;Smart TV&#34; lacks sufficient buffering for HD U-Tube. I got a new standard 3.0 modem and it boosted my speed from 4 MBPS to 13 MBPS with TWC &#34;standard&#34;. I think that helped, but there was still some buffering on HD U-Tube. Standard format in U-Tube was fine with no buffering and we watched a full old movie with no interruptions. I tested the same HD U-Tube program through my computer and connect it to the TV with no buffering at all so that is an alternative work around . Overall I am very happy and glad I got it, and would give 5 stars if not for the Smart features being a little less than anticipated. P.S. Remote is awkward for typing in searches.  Weather on old Samsung could be pulled up while still watching TV but leaves broadcaset on the new set. I also wish something other than MSN was the default web home page since typing is hard to go elsewhere.
