It is a great TV.  I had a little bit of an issue with the picture at the beginning but once we put the controls on auto (brightness, contract, etc.) it seemed much better.  The only complaint I have is that for a 60 inch TV, I think the pedistal holding it should be much sturdier in order to keep it completely secure.
