A few days ago I purchased a new Samsung UN50ES6100 Smart TV.  I will be returning it in the morning.  While the quality of the picture is great, the internet capability is an illusion.  I used it twice successfully for a grand total of two hours.  Every subsequent effort to connect to the internet for any app resulted in an error code or a message indicating that it could not connect when the 'Network Status' window indicated a great connection.  Samsung's claims are less than honest!  While the unit uses the word 'Smart' in its description, my decision to purchase was not.
