I found this tv easy to connect into my system to replace a 7 year old Sony LCD HD 55 incher. Fabulous picture on this tv but one annoying problem that is cause for it to be returned. When changing from and HD cable channel to a non-HD channel, the screen goes black. If I cycle through the Smart Tv screen and then back to the cable input, the picture comes back. Same thing happend going the other way. Not acceptable. And not a cable provider problem because I never had this problem with the Sony HDTV. Too bad, this one had to go back. Now to figure out a replacement that will not have this problem but will have such a good picture....hmmm.
