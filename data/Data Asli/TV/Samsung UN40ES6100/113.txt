I replaced my bedroom Samsung 2004 projection TV with this one. Both are 46' screens. The old TV was getting a bit faded and the HDMI connector was becoming loose which caused video noise problems (even though I used component RGB). No surprisingly, the differences we striking. I also have a Samsung 58' Plasma and Blue-Ray DVD player in the living room. So far, I judge the new bedroom TV to be superior to the plasma but I am using component connections for the plasma and, based on what I am seeing with the HDMI (cable box) connection I thibnk I'll try that for the plasma too.Set up was relatively simple. WPS worked properly. Though the included owners guide is thorough, it is written by a non-English speaker and that makes it an exercise is encryption. Regardless, I got the TV to up what I assume was some kind of firmware (the on-screen message did not define it) and add many Smart TV Apps. I also downloaded the ALLshare software to my PC. That was not a good experience and despite opting out of it, it added some kind of toolbar that overrode all my preferences for a home page in favor of some kind of (White Snake??)Search engine. That allowed me to use Allshare which, BTW, still is awful. Also, as many here have already said the pick and peck on-screen keyboard is a slow, frustrating means of character entry. That has not changed in years!!! I have not tried to program the remote so it operates my cable box but I was able to get my cable box remote to turn the TV on and off. I suspect this will not be a straight-forward process as my cable box is not listed on their code list. I have a few wireless keyboard systems sitting around so I'll try to use one of them but I also know I have a better chance of winning the lottery than getting one to work with the TV. Samsung just does not get how angry many of its customers are about this. It needs to be addressed and done so it is backwardly compatible. I have only had the TV 1 day so more to come as it develops.
