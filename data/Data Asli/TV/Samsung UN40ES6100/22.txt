I had a 7 year old Samsung LCD TV, in my bedroom, that did not have a good picture. My main TV is plasma because of superior picture (color and motion). If you are in the same camp, read on. When my bedroom TV gave up the ghost recently, I started to research other TVs.  I knew there are only 3 major LCD panel makers, and really do not know whose panel you are getting in the brand TV you are buying. The real difference is in processing, features, and quality. For LCD TVs, Samsung, Sharp, and Sony are the best (IMHO). Looking at features and price, I decided to go with this Samsung ES6100 40&#34; LED TV.Let's cut to the chase. The HD picture is extremely crisp, sharp and clean. The color rendition is very good. Flesh tones are excellent. Reds are true (which is a problem with many LCDs). The only minor complaint about color is that some pinks (especially on comercials) pop out really bright. Samsung has really hit a homerun with this TV. My plasma TV is no longer my favorite.
