It went onto the existing mount very easily -- hooked up to my system with no serious issues.  It is a cleaver design to make it work on your wifi and that functions pretty well.As with a lot of these systems -- I wish there was an easier way to make the remote more universal.  For some technical reasons beyond my ability I end up using multiple remotes and the remotes are the biggest issue when changing a TV -- the tail does wag the dog in this case -- remotes are the bain of our existence!Also you need to know you will need a key board to go with it -- not a big deal but a small wireless one works well.And some of the instructions are not clear on the steps or what does what on the software -- you will be trying to figure your way around the home screens for awhile.  This is not all that intuitive.  I am sure that Samsung would not appreciate this comment but it is NOT user friendly like most Apple products.But when it works and you get what you want -- it is a cool new TV with some nice features and outstanding video for the money.
