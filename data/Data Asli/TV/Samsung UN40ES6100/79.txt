The TV works great but the stand provided by Samsung makes the TV tilt downward to the right.  Since the TV is not level, the picture does not look level either.  The stand for this TV is seriously flawed in design.  I had to place a box at the bottom right corner of the TV to make the TV and the picture level. This is incredible!
