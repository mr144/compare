Overall the picture quality is very nice - but Samsung insists that you have all these crappy apps - and their server (SmartHub) are consistently down - which seems to be an ongoing problems since 2011 (if you go back and do some research). I would buy a SONY or Panasonic - SONY has already upgraded their system to handle major network traffic.
