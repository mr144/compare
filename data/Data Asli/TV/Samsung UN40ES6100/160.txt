This is a great TV set for those not wanting to spend a ton of money and still get a great picture. It's very economical and I am extremely please with it is performance. The picture is vivid and lifelike, with minimal if any ghosting or shadowing when I am watching fast paced action movies or sports. All in all great tv!!
