There are a lot of good reviews here but it does not matter when your TV is the one that fails. We have a previous model of the Samsung 55 in. LED TV, purchased at the end of 2011. We got a sizable gray spot on the screen at the end of 2012 - less than a week before the end of the warranty.Samsung sent out a repair team. It tried replacing the screen - which by the way costs $1,200. When the replacement screen failed, they said that Samsung would authorize an exchange. When we tried to do the exchange, the original retailer said we would have to pay an additional $500 to replace the failed TV with an equivalent model. Why would anyone do that, Samsung?Fortunately, the retailer located the same model in a warehouse. Otherwise, our understanding is that a store credit would have been issued - as opposed to a refund. We can not be sure because our Samsung contacts told so many different stories. Maybe Samsung should go into the publishing business instead.Meanwhile, Samsung's business model seems to deal with product failure by driving customers to other manufacturers.
