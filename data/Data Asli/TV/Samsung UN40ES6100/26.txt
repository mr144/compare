I bought this tv after looking at other reviews on amazon.com.  Overall, it is a great tv.  The picture is great, the &#34;Smart&#34; feature works with our wifi with no lag-time.  The sound could be better.  When watching dvds, I have to turn the volume up very loud to hear most of the dialogue.  I have tried different pre-set sound settings, but they do not seem to make any noticeable difference.  I think the only way to improve this is by getting a sound bar.While I like the tv a lot, the shipping was definitely an issue.  I chose the free shipping option through Amazon.  The order status page stated that the tv would be delivered on a certain day, but instead of reflecting the delivery date to my home, it was reflecting the drop date at the freight company.  After several calls between Amazon and the freight company, I was able to get a delivery appointment, but did not get the notification email about setting up a delivery appointment until a day after I had all these conversations.  Amazon definitely needs look into this issue so their website is reflecting the proper delivery date.All in all, this is a great tv at an awesome price.
