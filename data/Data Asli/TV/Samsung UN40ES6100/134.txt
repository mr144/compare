I think once I turned it on for the first time I cried a little bit. Yea it does not have the stupid 3D Bull@#$% but who wants to where glasses to watch tv anyway. There are some thing that should remain 2D. The smart hub is really nice and easy to navigate. I would suggest getting a wireless keyboard to make your life allot easier. Really with Amazon instant, netflix and Hulu pluss as long as you have internet you really do not need cable. If you are looking for a good TV that you do not have to take out a lone for this would be a good option.
