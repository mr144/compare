So, today, Monday April 1, 2013, Samsung is apparently doing server maintenance on their service, which apparently is not the first time they have had to take down the service. So while this is happening, this frakkin' annoying dialog that says 'Network is not connected. Check Network Settings to use Internet services. (ERROR_MODEL_BIND)' keeps popping up every other minute, c0ckbl0cking my play on the XBox. Of course I verify my internet connection via WiFi and it is just fine, working as usual as confirmed by the TV. This annoying dialog makes watching TV unbearable, and games unplayable, and the TV just as useful as a frakkin' brick. I am giving them a one-star for this s***ty 'SmartTV' service that's ruining the rest of the TV's capabilities.
