Pros:Nice and crisp display, incredible image, and sound is not bad, but if you are going to buy a flatscreen better get the home theater system.DLNA and AllShare connectivity works perfect. I have an S3 and an iPad and both can function as a remote control. I can instantly play and movies on the computer to the screen wirelessly. I have not yet had the need to use cables for anything, which to me is a big plus.Cons:Software and SmartHub are still lightyears away from acceptable. They should incorporate some type of Android platform on it, in the meantime, the apps are a little slow at times, but they work nontheless.
