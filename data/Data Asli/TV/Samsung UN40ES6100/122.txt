I have had the Samsung 46 inch Smart TV (Samsung UN46ES6100) for a few months and absolutely love it.  The important 'wins' for me from the tv include:- 3 HMDI ports- Crystal Clear picture- Pretty darn good sound out of the box (I have a large living room and feel no need for surround sound or even a sound bar, although I will probably get one anyways)- The last big win for me is the actual smart function, which I noticed a lot of viewers had negatives on.  Now I can only really talk about what I use it for - streaming amazon rented movies and free stuff through prime - but I use it all the time.  Hooking the tv up to my wireless was a breeze and connecting to my amazon account was also extremely easy.  In no time I had the options of 1000s of shows and movies at my finger-tips, and as long as your internet is not completely awful - renting in HD from amazon is nice too.Overall - Love the TV - by no means am I an expert in home entertainment, but for your average person who enjoys watching tv and movies - There is nothing better for the money as long as you have high speed internet or wifi that you can connect your tv too (and have netflix or amazon prime)
