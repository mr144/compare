I have owned this TV for about a month now. The TV is great! The Smart HUB is awful! The web browser is poor beyond description. Links within a site will not load, the entire Smart Hub decided to crash one day and then came back 2 days later! Netflix crashes and makes me sign on again with the remote which really sucks.I no longer use the Smart Hub for anything. I use my Roku player for Netflix.Save your money and buy a Samsung TV w/o the Smart Hub.Nice picture.
