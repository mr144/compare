I have had this TV for about three weeks.  It has yet to work properly.  Smart Hub is extremely slow to load.  My apps mysteriously disappear,  network connection fail periodically, and I cannot stream video via router or wi-fi direct.  I have tried to get help from Samsung, but they do not have techs working on Saturday or Sunday.  They keep claiming there is a server issue on their end, but I should not be affected by a server if I am streaming directly from my phone to the TV anyway.  My GS III is streaming fine over the same network anyway.  I am trying to return the TV for a new one now.  Let's see how that goes.
