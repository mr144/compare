item is already broken....amazon says itll take a month to send me a new one.samsung claims its under warranty, and will send someone out to fix it.  still no contact from said &#34;authorized repair center&#34;so after paying 1500 bucks, and it taking weeks to be delivered, I think I got to watch it perhaps 2 days before it broke.
