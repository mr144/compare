I use this in a small meeting area instead of a projector, and it works perfectly. The channel auto-configuration for our cable connection worked a bit haphazardly, but as that was not the primary reason for getting the device it was a minor detraction.  Picture is sharp, configuration was simple.  Works great with my Nyrius ARIES Pro Digital Wireless HDMI Transmitter and Receiver System. Has a little oversaturation issue with screens with a lot of red in them, but that's not unusual in a lot of devices.  I would get another one without hesitation.
