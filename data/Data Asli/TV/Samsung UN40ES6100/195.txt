I have only had Sony TV's till this point but could not resist the price, size and smart hub all in one. It took longer then expected to arrive but it is the holiday season so what can you do. The remote did'nt work when I added the batteries and it will take a month until Samsung can get me a new one. On a positive note, My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 has the remote app that controls all the features so Im not dead in the water.The picture really needs to be fine tuned as its not ready to go right out of the box like most sony TV's but all in all Im very happy with it
