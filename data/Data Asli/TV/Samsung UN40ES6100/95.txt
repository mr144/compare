This tv is great when viewing HD content.  It is easy to set up and the &#34;Smart Hub&#34; function is well thought out and easy to navigate.  Having a full keyboard would have been a plus.The one major down side is that viewing non HD channels is poor. The picture is blurred. I tried to change the setting but that has not helped. There is no compaison to my 46 inch Sharp Quattron. The picture on this tv is awesome.Bottom line, if using this tv for HD viewing then it is not a bad choice, if you want to watch a mix of HD and regular definition, keep looking.
