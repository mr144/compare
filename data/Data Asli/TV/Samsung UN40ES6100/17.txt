I purchased the TV for my bedroom and have been pleasantly surprised with it.  The tv picture is great and the screen makes it look clear and better than real life.  I am glad I went with the smart tv option as the samsung store has some great apps like Pandora, Netflix, Amazon Cloud, and many others.  I definitely prefer this over the apple tv, which seems very restrictive on the apps you can use.  After downloading and playing with apps, I only wish it had a little larger memory as I can see this being something restrictive in the future.
