Picture quality is great.  The apps arent as fast as using an XBOX or something of that nature, but they work 100%.  For all you super techies out there who like to download shows and movies in HD, this it the TV for you.  As long as they are AVI or MP4 format, you can stream the files from Windows right to the TV without flaw and the TV remote controls it perfectly.  I love this thing.
