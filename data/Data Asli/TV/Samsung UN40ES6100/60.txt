I was expecting it to be a nice tv, but amazing is more like it. I replaced a 240 hz LG LCD with this TV and watched Lord of the Rings The two towers and you can not tell a difference during the action scenes.  Delivery was a breeze! Guy came in unboxed ensured it was working and took away all wrapping.  I have a Samsung  laptop and Galaxy siii smart phone and with &#34;all share&#34; can share content quickly among the 3. The only downside is awkward remote use as a keyboard with the browser.
