This TV was very highly rated, which is why we selected it.  But I am having a number of problems with it:1) It takes an EXCESSIVELY long time for the TV to respond to the remote.  E.g., when I want to change the channel, or look at the guide, or go to On Demand - it takes much longer than it should.  Very frustrating.2) More serious:  I can not get my Netflix streaming (which I am PAYING FOR!) or Amazon video store because the TV has a 'bug.' I only learned this when I called Samsung to find out why I was not seeing these options.3) The TV had a bug - but the company did not contact its customers!  For weeks I was spending hours trying to fix what I thought was MY problem!  Terrible customer service!  Samsung should have contacted its clients reporting the bug - and should be contacting us regarding the status of resolution!  Really, really shameful!If it were not such a pain I would return this and look for a better TV.
