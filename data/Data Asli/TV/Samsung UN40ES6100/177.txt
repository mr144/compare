I went into this purchase with a little trepidation having read some of the other reviews that warned of the performance of this display.  Honestly though, I could not be happier.  We got a fair price around black Friday - $800, though i did still pay the $900 I have seen it on sale for in brick-and-mortar shops.  After calibrating and shutting off whatever Samsung calls their tru-motion anti-blur option, the picture is great.  Sound is a little weak, but I think that's to be expected in a TV that's just over an inch thick.  Just get a soundbar, I guess.We own a Roku, so I did not need a smart TV, really; I am glad we went with the ES model though instead of the EH though - less components and wires seem like a good idea.  The smart TV Hub is pretty slow though.  That's one area I'll agree with the other reviewers on.  I have not tried any of the higher range 2012 Samsung sets in store, but I am guessing they have faster processors or more memory to be a little snappier.Oh, and download a remote app on your phone - it is really frustrating trying to navigate the clunky browser or search in apps with the stock Samsung remote, even worse than typing with the old Roku remote.  Otherwise, enjoy your set!
