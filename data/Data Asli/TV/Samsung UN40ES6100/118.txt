it is wicked smaht! I actually got rid of cable and use Amazon prime and netflix and hulu for content and the user interface on this tv is awesome. the UI for amazon prime and netflix on this is really nice as well. I do not play video games and there are not a lot of great 3d movies out there yet so I did not need 3d or 240 version for twice the price. this one is great and visually looks amazing as well.
