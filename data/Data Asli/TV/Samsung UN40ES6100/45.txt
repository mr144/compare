Don' have any use for the smart apps. Use this tv exclusively as a computer monitor with my Mac Mini.  Originally bought a MAC 27 inch monitor for 1k but didn like it because its so tiny and not worth 1k. for half of that i got a great 40 inch LED tv with gorgeous pictures and decent built-in sound and at 230 Hertz, can not beat it. This 40 inch version is PERFECT for a bed room. Get it for the picture quality. For smart apps, better off getting a smart dvd player from Samsung or a Roku or Apple TV. The built-in app is a hit or miss so don' expect a good experience.
