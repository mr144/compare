This unit is great considering the technology available. It can not be evaluated based on a cable signal considering cable refreshes at 60mHz & this unit is faster at 240mHz. You will be able to see the differences in quality of the input on the other end, ie. digital vs analog, high def vs older tech. Blueray is a dream come true. In short, the rest of the industry needs to catch up to the quality of this unit. As for &#34;Smart TV&#34;, I can live without it. It's slow, requires me to get a wireless keyboard & mouse to use it & I have to agree with others who have said...&#34;my lap top is a lot quicker.&#34; To  be fair, this is the same complaint all of these &#34;smart tv's&#34; have in common. Time & tech will speed things up. I got this to have a wireless monitor for my laptop. Should have done more research. A hard wire is still the best way to stream from a laptop from more than 10 feet away. I guess if all I needed was social media & online services I did be much happier. But all I wanted was a monitor to stream to.
