I bought the TV based on the built in wireless and because of Samsung's reputation on TVs. The TV is 3 rooms away from the wireless router and performs well. Picture is great and have not had one issue with it since.Shipping was fast and showed up in great condition.Assembly of the base was simple and setting up the TV programs for the first time was easy.
