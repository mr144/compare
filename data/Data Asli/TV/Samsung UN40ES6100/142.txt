I have now owned 4 high def televisions in 8 years. My first a 37' Sony CRT model. Very big, heavy (150 lbs) with a perfect picture.Next was a 37' Samsung with a nice look and picture.Couple of years later upgraded to a Samsung 40' Smart tv Again, a nice look and picture and Yahoo widgets The Netflix library was also very nice and has a preferable interface to the one on this new set in my opinion.I recently decided to upgrade to a bigger screen with the new slimmer bezel. Bought a Sony 46' and never got a high def picture on it. Was on the phone with Sony for the better part of an hour. Returned for a refund.Then tried a Vizio 46'. Had a beautiful frame on it but it kept messing with my DVR high def resolution (again spent a lot of time on phone with Vizio support.) While I was toying with it I also noticed it had a flaw in the screen on the left upper corner. Returned for a refund.Came back to Samsung with this set and it set up easily and perfectly. The picture is excellent, even better than my previous two Samsungs. With the nice slim bezel. My opinion and experience is nobody does overall quality better than Samsung.Some people it seems prefer the 4 pronged leg stand over the solid glass. I do not. The stand looks like cheaply painted black metal to me. Much prefer the glass swivel.Also I became addicted to the ease of use of Yahoo widgets (popped up at the bottom of the screen) for checking the weather while continuing to watch tv.  I checked the weather and temperature all the time with my old set. Also Pandora and Amazon instant video were more easily accessed using widgets.Having said all that, this new set was on sale @ $799 and it is a very good tv and a lot of it @ that price.
