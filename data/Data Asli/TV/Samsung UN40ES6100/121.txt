This TV is amazing and size makes this a must buy. However, they offer a non-smart tv version that I would rather buy. The smart features are not that great and do not work as you would want them too. Entering text is also a pain in the butt. They should update the remote with a style like Boxee with a keyboard.Other than the smart features, the TV is amazing and I am very happy with it.
