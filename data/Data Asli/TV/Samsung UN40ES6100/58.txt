Here is the list of problems:-Too much glare off the screen for bright rooms-Needs serious tweaking of the image specs as the default settings look terrible! Even after the calibration that you find on internet, the picture seems hazy-Was planning on mounting the TV with slim mount but the power cord and the wires come straight out of the back....Otherwise the TV is OK, I would keep it if I did not have to destroy my wall to mount it or spend hours trying to modify the picture quality.Bottom line I am returning it!
