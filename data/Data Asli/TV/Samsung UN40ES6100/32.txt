UPDATE.....This is NOT A 240HZ (refresh rate) television.....I have been asking Amazon and Samsung ( asked Samsung to contact Amazon regarding improper advertising)  to change their advertising...THIS IS A 120hz  not a 240hz set....this can be confirmed by Samsung...I First let me start by saying I gave this HDTV 2 stars simply because it does indeed have a very nice picture...HOWEVER with that said I wanted a GREAT picture...I purchased this TV because Amazon is marketing it as being 240hz and one would assume that it follows that the refresh rate would be 240...WRONG....Samsung I believe has purposely come out with this new BS format CMR ( clear motion rate)  Many consumers, and I believe Amazon  themselves, were taken in with the ' new rating'....Amazon employee told me that they indeed were confused as they believed the TV was 240hz but after I called Samsung upon receiving the TV and it was not what I expected found out it was not 240hz but 240CMR....it is actually only 120hz....it is being improperly marketed by Amazon.  All of us out there really need to do our homework....they are charging you more money because you think you are getting something that you are not...in this case a 240hz LED HDTV vs. 120 hz LED HDTV...would not have paid this money for a 40' 120hz HDTV....very deceptive and I expect Amazon to pay a bit more attention to detail before marketing their products moving forward. I believe ( or I really want to believe) that Amazon made an honest mistake with there marketing....so just to be clear this is a 120hz LED HDTV not a 240hz LED HDTV
