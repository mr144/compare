If you are wall mounting the tv, make sure your mount can clear the power cord housing, I do not know why Samsung did not move the plug, such a simple thing to overlook.Out of the box, the picture is definitely un-natural, so tweaking is required. Before that, I ran the software update; it seemed to go through, but I had to AC cycle the TV before the update took effect.I plan to use tv for Amazon Instant Video streaming, and that set up took time. All the other apps just worked as soon as network cable was attached, but the Amazon app failed to load, or quit without any message (I still have not figured out why). Amazon customer service could only suggest attempting to re-install the firmware, but the TV would not let me as it was already running the latest. The Amazon Instant Video app is baked in, and cannot be removed. Eventually, I set the DNS server to 8.8.8.8 (Google's public ones), and finally the Amazon app would run. Once I registered the TV, my watchlist was transferred, and I was streaming in HD; the quality is great.The best part of this TV however is the ability to stream from any device connected to the network. I do not know if the other series have this feature, or just the 'smart' ones, but definitely worth the extra money. The TV automagically saw my Windows shares, and found the media; it seems to be able to handle Xvid and MPEG4 files (I did not have any success with h.264 encoded files).  The TV is limited to MP4 files less than 4GB (or maybe slightly smaller).The sound is better than I was expecting from such a thin TV, and is more than adequate for daily viewing. I like how the Youtube app lets you filter results for HD and SD files, my Sony blu-ray player cannot do this.
