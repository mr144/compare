Do not buy it for the &#34;Smart&#34; features. They are frustratingly slow. I am in IT and I am used to dealing with frustrating situations but I had to give up on playing with this feature. BUT, I do enjoy the TV!I noticed after 2 months it has one dead pixel. There is a website that fixes this by connecting a computer to the TV. I have not tried it on mine yet though.
