About six months ago, subsequent to one of the updates Samsung rolled out, Netflix started acting up:  it takes anywhere from 2-20 (yes, 20!) attempts to actually play an item before it is successful.  This is extremely annoying, to say the least:  you can sit there pressing 'OK' over and over and over for a good 7 minutes before you can start viewing.Try watching a series of 30-minute shows this way.Then, some updates later, the problem got even worse:  now, I have to sign into Netflix EVERY TIME.  It does NOT remember my email or password.  I have to enter is all.  Again.  Every time.  And then I am still left with the '20 attempts before anything plays' problem.Now, before the nerds jump in here to blame me:  I am a nerd myself.  My network is well-configured.  I have tried both wired and wireless.  EVERY OTHER DEVICE works!  I have got a Roku, two tablets, various desktops and laptops, all running wirelessly, that have NO PROBLEMS with Netflix.Also, Amazon Video experiences the exact same behavior!  So this is obviously NOT my Network, or Netflix:  it is a Samsung problem.  Now I have a $1200 item that does precisely one of the many things it was supposed to do:  it shows pictures.
