Great picture, sound quality is amazing, remote control is not that ergonomically efficient, and SMART TV, not so much.  i have several devices that are connected wirelessly, yet the TV will connect then 3 minutes later disconnect.  My techy buddy could not even figure it out.  when it is connected,' typing' is difficult at best.
