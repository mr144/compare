Overall I like the TV and would recommend it to anyone, however, I am not sure if I would ever go through the process of purchasing a TV from Amazon in the future or if I would recommend it to anyone else.The TV:Very nice, quite slim, and very light compared to my previous 50in Samsung Plasma TVPicture quality is great, motion plus takes some getting used to and you may need to adjust the picture settings to fit your needs.Sound quality could use some work. I still have not found the perfect volume level/setting and find that it could range from 9 to 50 depending on the source or input.Accessing the Smart Hub can vary in loading speed, but exiting seems to be pretty quick overall. The All Share Play function shows up within the available input source menu and  can directly access content directly from compatible devices.The Vendor:Paul's TV did keep me notified regularly via email on the overall progress of processing and shipping my order. I was very disappointed to see that they dropped price to $1099 almost immediately after I purchased this TV for $1167.I placed my order on March 5th with an estimated delivery between March 11th and March 14th. Due to inefficiencies and challenges related to the shipping process using multiple delivery vendors, I did not receive the TV until March 15th.The local delivery provider had me sign the delivery paperwork before allowing me to ensure that I received the correct model, that it functioned properly, and that nothing was missing. This is concerning, since the box is labeled with instructions to test everything before signing to accept delivery.
