I would give this TV five stars except for the fact that it only has a single receptor for sound input from my Sony Bravia sound system. I was able to get a 2 to 1 adapter which works, but my husband is hard of hearing and there is no where to plug in his wireless earphones. Everything works fine for cable TV, but when we go to the hub we can only get the sound through the Sony. The TV continues to play sound from the cable. The picture is great and the set up could not have been easier. Wish I could figure out some way to get the wireless earphones to work when we are streaming Netflix or Amazon Prime.
