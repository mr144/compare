Likes: Screen is nice and crisp, clear, levels of black are more than adequate. Smart TV functionality works well and wireless built-in is a nice bonus.  Apps give added value (Netflix, Amazon Watch Instant, Pandora). DLNA implementation works well.Dislikes: Smart TV functionality takes quite a while (subjectively) to load.  Also seems to take a long while for account to login and for wireless as well as  Apps to get to a working point.  (Though once they are ready, there is no problem or delay)Overall: Definitely worth the cost.  Have had no problems with the TV.  The DLNA implementation allows access to my media collection running on my computer, as well as streaming Netflix and Amazon allow for a great set that meets my needs, if not exceeds them.
