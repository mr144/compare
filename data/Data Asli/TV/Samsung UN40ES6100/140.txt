Purchased this TV over the previous holiday season and we are very pleased with it.  My only complaint is that as another reviewer noted elsewhere, several of the I/O ports are mounted facing directly backward.  This sort of defeats the purpose of a very slim tv/mount.  I have an HW E550 soundbar (configured as twin pedestal speakers) that is connected via the HDMI/ARC port (for Amazon Streaming and Netflix audio) and the cable sticks directly out the back of the TV to a depth of over 2'.  I would imagine a right-angle HDMI connector would solve most of this issue.  Also, for 'non-cinematic' viewing (e.g. news, TV dramas, etc) the on-board speakers work just fine.
