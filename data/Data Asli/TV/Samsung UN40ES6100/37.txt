You must use the setting by brice S., totally made a difference of our viewing pleasure.I got the 40&#34;, very thin, very light weight, was easy to program and get started, but the review by brice is right on the money.I took the reviewers advice from internet research about the refresh rates of TV's  that that anything over 240, is not worth the money, and I would have to agree, plus I saved a lot of money.The only real CON: so far  is that it has a hard time connecting to internet if you are using your amazon prime account feature, it is a hit and miss if you connect and definitely a software issue.
