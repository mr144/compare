You can not argue with the picture for the price. There are very few models offering 1080 resolution on a 40 inch screen for right around $400. This TV is easy to set up and the picture is terrific. The only significant drawback is the audio. I had to max the bass and completely take out the treble, then crank the volume all the way, just to make it passable.Why they could not include an analog audio output is beyond me. I did not intend to have to upgrade my entire home entertainment system just to buy a new TV. So now I'll have to drop anywhere from $40 to $100 for a digital to analog converter for my stereo or a basic sound bar just so I can get decent audio. Suddenly the terrific price for the TV looks more like a so-so price.If you already have optical digital audio equipment then this is not a concern to you; in which case I heartily recommend this TV for the video. If you still have an analog home audio system -- and you do not plan to upgrade soon -- consider the extra cost you'll need to enjoy this TV with your stereo or powered speakers.
