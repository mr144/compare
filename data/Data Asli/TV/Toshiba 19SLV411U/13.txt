I purchased this TV as a gift for my daughter's 18th birthday in Dec 2011.  In Sept 2012 the TV quit working, just would not turn on anymore.  After trying the trouble shooting methods available on the product website without success, I proceeded to call for technical support.  First, a recording told me that my product's warranty had expired.  When I finally was able to speak to a Representative, I was told that  the only option available to me was to send the TV to a Toshiba Depot for repair and the warranty would cover the repair expense....They would forward an email with specific instructions on packing and mailing, and that the packing supplies and the shipping fee to mail the TV to the Depot Center for repair were the responsibility of the customer.  In my opinion, any company that has been around as long and is as large as Toshiba that is worth its salt would at least supply a prepaid mailing lable.  I feel I paid $200 for a faulty TV that did not even last a year without going on the blink, and in addition, I am out the cost of shipping it for repair.  When I asked to speak to someone to express my displeasure with the process, I was cut off while on hold...TWICE!!! I know enough to have the set professionally packed and to spring for added shipping insurance, as I am sure they could easily blame a number of problems on the set not being packed properly and I would likely be out the full $200 plus the added expense.  This is the last product I will ever buy from Toshiba.
