This television alomg with a wall mount bracket,was purchased for a toddlers bed room. The idea is too keep the tv out of the child's reach while preserving desk top space. This television with it is built in DVD player fits the bill. The picture is good,and it is mounted safely out of the child's reach,and far enough out of the way that the is not viewing it too closely. It was  priced  pretty competivily so  that you do not mind paying  it for a kid's room
