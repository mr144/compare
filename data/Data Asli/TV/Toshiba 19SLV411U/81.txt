I was excited when I ordered this television since I was replacing a 36' tube Toshiba with a 1080p LCD.  However, I was disappointed with it.  The sound on this TV was terrible and after trying to adjust it many ways, I decided to return the TV.  The only way I could watch with any satisfaction was through a sound system and that to me was just too much effort.  Picture was ok, but the horrible sound system was a bit too much to overlook.
