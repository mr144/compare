Found this item on Craigslist, picked it up for $320 from a guy who decided he needed money more than a big TV.  It was 1 month old, just out of the return date for the brick and mortar store that he bought it from.  Despite having no reviews online, I figured it was a 40' LCD for less than $400, and took the risk.This TV is awesome.  Set it up with the included stand, chained it to the wall for safety, as the stand is a little narrow and I did not want to tempt fate. Hooked this up to a junker PC running the latest copy of XBMC on Windows XP, this combo is awesome!  I know I will upgrade the HTPC in the future, but for now this combo runs great, looks great, and I am very happy.Will update after I have had this for awhile, but this TV is definitely worth the $320 I have in it, and would be a good deal at $450 like I have found it for elsewhere...
