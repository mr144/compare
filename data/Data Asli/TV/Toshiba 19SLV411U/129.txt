The tv plays ok, nothing special, one reason for low rating is I could not get one screw to go in straight into the mounting bracket for the stand, (not 1 out of 8 went in straight), and I know my way around a screwdriver! On top of that I have heard better speakers in pocket transister radios in the 1960s. I connected an old set of computer speakers which gave much improvment! I was hunting something cheap, and guess what, I found it!!
