First time I received this model there was a dead pixel at the center of the screen. Amazon is amazing with returns, but I had inconvenience with bringing it to a UPS location that accepts such oversize packages.The second TV worked well for 2 weeks. Now it does not recognize any incoming sings in the HDMI plugs.Otherwise it would be a good value, great picture etc.But I have spent far too much time trying to solve the problems it made.
