We needed a small flat screen for our bedroom. We live in a 5th wheel trailer and space is limited. After looking at different places and prices versus product I chose this one. I read the previous reviews. The sound quality is pretty good. It does not sound 'tinny' or cheap. I also have it mounted so the sound is free to emanate rather than being enclosed. This may help. It does not have a clock but no big deal. All the functions work good and for a 720p tv it has a good picture. We have a 1080p Viera in our living room and HD running to it. So I would not try to compare them equally. Great price and great tv for us.
