I have had the Toshiba 19SLV411U 19-inch TV/DVD combo unit for about 3-4 weeks now, and I am generally quite pleased with it.  I use it in my at-home office where space is cramped, thus its small form-factor works perfectly, and I love the fact that I do not need to have a separate DVD player or too many cables showing.  Picture quality is very pleasing, better than what I expected from a unit this small/inexpensive and setup was a no-brainer.  If I have any complaint, I think it is that the sound quality has a slight tinny nature to it, but obviously this could be fixed with decent external speakers if I so chose.  All things considered, I am very pleased with this product, and it looks like Santa might be bringing another one to our house this Christmas.
