I use this for viewing a surveillance camera. For that purpose it is very good. It is small so it does not take up much room and has good video quality. I have NOT use this as a TV or viewing other video/TV content so I cannot comment on the overall quality of picture and sound. So if you need something small for surveillance viewing then this will do the job.
