The 19&#34; screen is excellent for passively viewing tv while working in 65the kitchen. The quality of the picture is great; and the DVD player is an excellent ancillary feature. The only negative is the audio, which is low quality due to the small size of the speakers....but since it is in my kitchen, I can live with that issue.
