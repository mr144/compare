I bought this TV several months ago.  The picture and remote I would rate as excellent.  HOWEVER, the sound is TERRIBLE.  I always thought Toshiba put out quality products but how they let this one out with such crappy sound is beyond me.  I simply could not understand what was spoken!  I suspect they took some crappy speakers from their laptop division and put them in this unit.  I finally went to Walmart and bought some Logitech external computer speakers and they work fine.  However, I cannot control the sound through the remote (the audio out receptacle has a fixed output and the tone level does not work with this output) and have to go over to the right remote speaker to adjust the audio.  If you do not mind buying some external speakers then this is a good TV but otherwise I suggest you look around for something else!
