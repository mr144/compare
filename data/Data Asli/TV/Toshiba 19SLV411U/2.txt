This item is a piece of garbage! I purchased two for my camper a year ago and they sat in the box since then. I put one in my daughters room when she moved back in and put all of her household goods in the camper I was going to put them in. The TV lasted five months and now will not go on. When I set out to buy these, there were only a few reviews around and they only mentioned the sound quality. Well, after a year, there are a number of reviews that say these stop working. Moreover, when I looked on the internet for ways to fix it, I found a number of other Toshiba products that stopped working.I recommend that no one buys another Toshiba product again, they are pieces of junk!!!!!!!!!To stop buying their products, is the only way they are going to stop making this junk we are spending our hard earned money on!
