I bought this TV less than 1 year ago. After 10 months of regular use (i.e. 1-2 hours in evenings and on weekends) the power would not come on for the TV. I called the service line and they arranged for a technician to come out with a new power board.  This took a couple of weeks to get the part and arrange the visit. The maintenance technician came out and inserted a new power board, and the TV worked for a couple hours and then the power went out again. The service line and the technicians have been helpful, courteous, and prompt. However, this raises fundamental issues about the reliability of this model
