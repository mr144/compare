Love this TV, bought it when I moved into my apartment last September. I wanted something that would be big enough to watch football on and have a good picture and I was on a budget. This is my first apartment and my first real TV, my boyfriend is jealous because it is a better quality than the expensive big screen he has at his house. I am in love with the TV and would recommend it to anyone!!
