The original TV we ordered was defective; Amazon was wonderful in making sure it was picked up, a second new TV was delivered within 48 hours assuring  us that we had it for Christmas day - great service!(this was our ONLY gift this year)However, this second set has a volume problem; we have to tune the volume up to 70-90 in order to hear the audio clearly.  I probably should have called and had the set returned for still ANOTHER one but did not feel up to dealing with the many emails and phone calls.One the good side, the picture quality is great - sharp, clear and colorful.
