My husband and I bought this for our bedroom to be used for watching tv and to be used at our computer monitor.It was time to replace the old humpback.I searched online for a while and read reviews. This one has some mixed reviews mostly pertaining to sound quality.This unit had a great price and featured all the inputs/outputs that I thought necessary.Once it arrived it was simple to set up. It's light weight and was easily attached to a universal wall mount arm. The picture is EXCELLENT. (We have a 50&#34; hdtv in our family room and I prefer this one) There is no glare from the screen, the frame is simple and not distracting, sound is perfectly fine to me.When I use it on computer mode I have fantastic clarity for working on photoshop projects. A 40&#34; is a bit big for a computer, so sometimes when I am facebooking or web surfing I just move further away. I scoot back in my chair and have my wireless key board and mouse in my lap.I have not encountered any flat screen tvs that had movie theater sound so I do not understand the complaints. If you want a flat screen and you want surround sound with booming base you need to fork out the extra money and get a sound system.So yes, I would definitely recommend this to a friend!
