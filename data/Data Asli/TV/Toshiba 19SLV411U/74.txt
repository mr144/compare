Toshiba...lets see..TV out of service for the 4th time in 11 months...everytime its the same issue- main board...takes 6-7 weeks for Toshiba to send some one to replace the main board. Also, Toshiba outsources the job to some local company which take their sweet time to come to your place. Their Customer service is nothing short of a disaster. I do not know how they are still in Business..need to be reported to Consumer Act. Never buy a Toshiba product again. They only wait for your warranty to get over so that they can close your case. This company treats their customers as shit..they are 10 times worse than Dell.
