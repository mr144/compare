i purchased this item used on amazon, no problems with the delivery, got it fast, used the dvd once , by the second time, the disc was getting stuck, and im pretty sure the previous 5 or 6 ownersof this same TV returned it for the same reason, the selling point (built in DVD) DOES _ NOT WORK, and if if does, it will last you 1 or two months. so get off the couch and just get a regular DVD at walmart. target or whatever.
