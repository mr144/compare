Got this for my 7 yr old daughter's room for Christmas.  So far only hooked up to DVD player (so as to control what she is watching).  Awesome picture, decent sound and every imaginable input you could possibly want.  Sure it is not my Samsung 56' with 1080p, but I would not put a 19' tv in my living room either.Well packaged, EASY connection to the included table base, extremely LIGHT WEIGHT was surprising (especially compared to LCD) and simple to setup.This is a GREAT QUALITY TV for an even better price.  Exactly what I was looking for at exactly the price I was hoping to find.  Excellent TV for bedroom, office, kitchen, shop or garage.
