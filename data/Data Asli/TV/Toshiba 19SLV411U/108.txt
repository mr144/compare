This is my first HD television although I have had experience working with them due to my job as a computer tech.  The picture quality on this TV is on par with the better screens I have seen.  When a BR disk is playing (connected with HDMI) it is astounding.  The sound on the unit goes very high without the vibration I have heard other TVs produce at higher volumes.  The high notes are a bit sharp on the unit at higher volumes and the only reason I gave it a 4 star on sound quality.Setup was simple...snap together some plastic for the base and plug it in.I have not used the unit with any other devices outside of my BR player.  I have used Vudu, Netflix, normal DVDs and Blueray and all look great.  Even the standard definition DVD and Netflix feeds look sharp.If you are wanting a TV that's simple to use without any fuss or tweaking with settings or configurations this one is perfect as that's what I was looking for in a TV.
