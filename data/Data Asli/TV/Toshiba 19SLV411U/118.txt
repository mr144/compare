We use this as a display monitor in a fairly bright hallway. As such, it is a little underpowered--  seems not quite bright enough.  In dimmer light or at night, it seems fine, however.  It does come with a lot of different mounting hardware options, which I thought was helpful.  Overall, seems totally solid.  Since it is on virtually all the time, I'll look forward to seeing how it holds up in durability.
