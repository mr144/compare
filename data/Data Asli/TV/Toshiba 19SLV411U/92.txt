Audio in and out is a little cumbersome to set up, however, the LCD HDTV is huge and Toshiba does displays really well for a reasonable price. I have 2 Toshiba laptops and 1 Sony Viao, the latter being the priciest, and I would never recommend shelling out for a Sony, if display quality matters to you.
