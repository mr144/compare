I am by no means a TV or electronics expert. I just needed a new TV for my 3 year old sons playroom. He had an ancient, heavy box TV in there and I could not stand to look at it anymore. I wanted one that had a built-in DVD player so I could take the PS2 out of that room and move it elsewhere. This TV fit the bill.We have had it now for about a month and I love it. At home we use it strictly for DVDs since there's no cable in his playroom, and the picture is beautiful. Sound is just fine and it is a breeze to set up and get working out of the box.We also use this TV in the master bedroom of our RV. This was the first time I had it hooked up to cable and watched regular TV on it. Again...great picture quality. The DVD player is simple to use (my 3 year old operates it himself when we are home), and the screen has adjustable tilt.Overall I am extremely happy with this TV. It's perfect for what I needed and I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking to use it in a similar fashion...as a child's or RV TV that can play DVDs. Anything more than that, I can not comment on.
