It quit working within a month of use.  Called Toshiba and after staying on the phone forever for someone to respond, they wanted us to send it back to them but we have to pay the shipping. They indicated no one in Omaha will service this TV. This got returned to Amazon for replacement so hopefully I can do a better review upon receipt of replacement. No sure if I will ever buy a Toshiba again.
