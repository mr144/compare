Last year I purchased the 15' model of this Toshiba TV-DVD combo thinking that it could be used as a PC monitor if need be (since I already owned the 22' model which CAN be used as a monitor).  But when my monitor broke this morning and I hooked up the 15' one, I discovered that it could NOT be used as a monitor, so I had to hook up the 22' one.  I then went on Amazon to purchase a replacement for the 22' one now being used as a monitor, searched for 'tv-dvd-monitor,' and the 15' version came up in the results, even though it cannot be used as a monitor!  I kept searching until I could find a clear statement that the model being described could be used as a monitor, which the page of this 19' model definitely did.  So I thought I had found my dream TV-DVD-Monitor until I read the reviews, one of which revealed that the 19' version HAD NO EARPHONE JACK!  Toshiba makes very reliable electronics, but it needs standardize the components of its small TVs--all should be able to be used as monitors, and all should have earphone jacks.  (Now I am afraid to read any more reviews, lest I discover that some models are missing even more basic things, such as an on-off button.)
