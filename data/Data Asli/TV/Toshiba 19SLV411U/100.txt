I bought this in the dip when it was $400 and my review reflects this price. At $450 there may be more attractive options out there.Unboxing: The stand is somewhat flimsy and cannot be angled. Assembly is straightforward.Powering Up: after the language selection there is a choice for Cable or Antenna. The TV took about 1 minute to find my local stations.Video: screen quality is great on HD sources. this seems to be a personal judgment, but it looks great to my eyes.Audio: I was prepared to hate it in light of the reviews, but for medium volume sound with mostly dialogue it is just fine in a medium sized living room.Remote: nothing of note. it works.Ports: you know what you are buying, so either it is sufficient for your needs or not. Both HDMI ports worked out of the box.----Conclusion: at $400 I feel like this was a great deal.
