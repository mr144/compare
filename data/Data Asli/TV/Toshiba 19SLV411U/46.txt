I bought this TV to put in front of my stationary bicycle in hopes that it would encourage me to use the bike.  So far, it is worked.  It has an great picture, sound is fine.  I have not tried the dvd player yet - I did better do that.  The Verizon man hooked it up with no problem.  I am really pleased.
