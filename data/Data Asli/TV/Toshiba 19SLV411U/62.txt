I recently purchased another brand on recommendation, and had difficulty with the company and FedEx.  Finally, unable to resolve it , Amazon just refunded my money and finished it for me(Another reason I'll always be a returning customer!).  I re-ordered another brand,  one I have always been statisfied with, having purchased laptops and DVR's from them through Amazon.  I bought tht e Toshiba 19' flatscreen tv with built-in DVD player, and was completely satisfied upon arrival.  It came timely, well-packaged, and with all components complete.  It started right up out of the box, was easy to set up, and had quality throughout;  the picture and sound were geat, and everything on it worked---first time!  Best of all, no delays, no 'rock and a hard place' between FedEx and TV company, and the process was smooth from order to setup.  As far as Toshiba as a company, I have always been satisfied, both with laptops and DVR's, and now, flatscreens!  Way to go, Toshiba and Amazon!
