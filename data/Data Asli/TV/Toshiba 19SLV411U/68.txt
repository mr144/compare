Within 9 months I had a major issue with pixel lines appearing throughout the screen intermittently. I am a fairly reasonable and patient person, but when it literally takes me over 5 attempts working with Toshiba Customer Service over a period of 2 weeks and several hours of my time with still no resolution, I feel justified in saying that is not just very poor, but unacceptable 'Service!' An example as to how it should work...SONY where I had an issue and had a replacement TV sent to my home within 2 days! I will never buy Toshiba again.
