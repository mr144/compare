We picked up this tv at Best Buy on Black Friday for $399. The picture quality is great and it was simple to setup, however the sound quality is definitely below average. Our 31' Sharp LCD has amazing sound compared to this set. We are planning on purchasing a sound bar to compensate as the base is non-existent and the sound very 'tinny'. Volume is also very low and we have the TV all the way up to the max. Still, for $399 it is a good value compared to others in it is class.
