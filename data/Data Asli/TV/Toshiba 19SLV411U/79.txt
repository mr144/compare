After reading the reviews I knew the sound quality would not be great, so I purchased an inexpensive sound bar which made the sound quality just fine.TV was easy to set up and connect to cable, DVD, and WII.Picture was great for first three weeks but now I am getting some pixelating on a couple of the channels.Waiting to hear back from company about this issue.
