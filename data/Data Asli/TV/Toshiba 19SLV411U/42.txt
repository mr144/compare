I bought this model, seeking specifically for the combination of screen size and built-in DVD player, and I am highly satisfied. It's not perfect, but what is? It could be closer to perfect, however, if Toshiba addressed some minor nits.1. It reverts to a default 4:3 aspect ratio whenever you turn it on, never mind that you have previously chosen a different aspect ratio. Annoying.2. As others have mentioned there's not much audio power, but for my purposes it is not a deal-breaker. It sits on my desk so I do not need it to play loud.3. There is no headphone jack, but... ditto.4. Front panel controls would be nice. Perhaps placed on the base or very skinny buttons placed on the bottom edge of the bezel. Aesthetics dictated the decision to place them on the side, probably, but I wish some TV manufacturer would decide that Function should be placed ahead of Form.5. The TV is smart enough to power up in DVD mode if you press Play on the remote, but it is dumb enough to power up in tuner mode if you press the power button, never mind that the unit was previously turned off in DVD mode.I bought a refurbished model from Amazon and the only flaw I have noticed is a subtle fingerprint on the screen that refuses to come off, though I do not want to scrub too hard. It's not noticeable at all when the unit is on, so no biggie.
