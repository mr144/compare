Ordered through Amazon and received TV the last week of July 2011.This TV is set up in my kitchen and used infrequently.  The sleek design is nice.  The picture is great. The sound quality is only 'okay' (a little on the anemic side).Now, here's my problem:  Yesterday, I tried the DVD player for the FIRST TIME.  I know, I should have tested it earlier, but I just assumed that it would work. I have had plenty of Toshiba products in the past that I was really satisfied with.The DVD player DOESN'T work.  :(It loads, processes for a few seconds, then ejects the disc. (I have tried a few different DVD's.)I have had it for 43 days and the limit for returns is 30 days.So, it seems that I am stuck with a TV with a DVD player that never worked. I could have paid a lot less for a slimmer set without the DVD player (but I really wanted the combo).
