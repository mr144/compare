Very nice picture and very good value for the money. Sound quality is lacking. My Lenovo laptop has better sound quality. I bought this for the bedroom but it is pretty big for bedroom. I will have to buy a big articulating arm to move it out of the way. I like that it has all connections and controls on side of TV. A lot of tv's now only have controls on the remote.
