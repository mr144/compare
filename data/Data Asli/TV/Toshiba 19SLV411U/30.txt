So excited to receive my new 19 inch Toshiba for my bedroom.  It came and I immediately set it up and turned it on.  The picture was OK but there was no sound.  I turned the volume up all the way and sat less than a foot from the screen and still could hardly hear it.  I have had Toshibas in the past and liked them.  I either got a lemon or their quality has really gone down hill.  I doubt if I will buy another Toshiba.
