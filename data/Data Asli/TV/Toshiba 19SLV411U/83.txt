If a specialist installs this TV at your home and connects it appropriately to a received or a H-T system, you'll be very pleased with its excellent performance. Otherwise, you'll be pleased with the picture but not very pleased with the sound - you need someone who knows what they' re doing in order to connect it properly. If the picture was 'just one tick' better, it could compete with much more expensive sets.
