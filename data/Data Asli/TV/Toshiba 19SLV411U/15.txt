Very nice picture, we only use it with over the air antenna signals.  The built in dvd player does not always eject the disc.  Have to turn it off and unplug and reboot in order to eject the disc.  Have only had it 70 days, may have to return it before the 90 day warranty is up because i do not see it lasting 5+ years with this issue.
