This is my first HDTV, and overall I am very pleased. The setup was quick and easy, and the picture quality is exceptional. However, the sound is even more shallow and tinny than previous reviewers have indicated. Hooking up the TV to amplified speakers is not only desirable, it is absolutely essential in order to enjoy this TV.
