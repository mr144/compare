This is a very good product.  The only complaint I have is that the speakers are of low quality and produce a tinny sound.  Otherwise, it is fine -- once I got through the interface between Toshiba Customer Support and Comcast Customer Support, both of whom spent way too much time pointing fingers at the other one.I would definitely buy this product again.  In fact, as my old-time cathode ray tube TVs give out, I will likely order an on-line replacement, if the price performance is as good as this one.
