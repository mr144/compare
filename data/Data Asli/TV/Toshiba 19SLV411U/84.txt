This TV really was a great price for us. We got it as a floor model, last one available and was the right place to replace a tube TV. The picture quality is definitely not on par with, lets say, a Vizio but you cannot beat the price and it does what it supposed to do--be a television. We have had difficulties with connecting various devices like a DVD player, but such is life. There are options to set the size of the screen image and we have played with many of the options and really, no option is really perfect.Overall, we are happy. It is a lot better than a tube TV which is what we had before.
