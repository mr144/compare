This 40 inch Toshiba is the forth Toshiba I own (also a 42 in, 46 in and a 55 in).  All of them great, no problems whatsoever. Terrific picture.  I have owned the 42in for 3 or 4 years, the 45in for 2 years, the 55in for 6 mos and the 40 in for one month. All are now in service, all excellent.  You can not go wrong with Toshiba and both the 55 in and the 40 in were bargains besides.  I also have a Samsung 46 which is great, but the Toshiba is the best value in my opinion.
