Got it for x-mas 2011. Easy set up. Performed as I expected it would. In early May is simply would not stay on for more than a few seconds. By May 15 it stopped turning on entirely. If I could give it no stars, that would be my rating. Odd, too, is that I have a Toshiba quite like it in another room that I have had for about 5 yrs. Love it. This one.. what can I say?
