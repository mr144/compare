Image: blacks are not so good; sort of cloudy grey in appearance.  My tweaks did not help much.  But for only a couple hundred, this is not such a big deal.Sound: stinks, as expected.  This TV is the worst. No realistic way of getting better sound.  There's no way I am gonna spend more than $50 for an external setup...so I guess I am outta luck!No matter, I did not buy this TV for its quality, but for its pricetag.
