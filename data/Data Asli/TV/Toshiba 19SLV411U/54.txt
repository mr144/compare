I purchased this product to allow time to past while on deployment. When I received the product it was prior to the estimated delivery date so I was very excited. When I tried to play a DVD, I found out that the DVD player did not work! I was so angry, so assumed it was the type of DVD so I purchased a DVD from the store for about 38.95 and it still would not play. I could not send back due to me being deployed, I had to purchase an additional dvd player! SUCKS!!
