I ordered this TV for a friend.  At the time I ordered the set, 4 out of 8 reviews complained about the sound.  I have a 37' Toshiba a couple years old and the sound is excellent for use as a TV in a modest size room.  I discounted the complaints assuming that they were expecting more out of it than they should.  I expected this one to be similar to mine as far as the audio was concerned.I installed it for my friend and noticed immediatly after completing the channel scan that the audio on local DTV stations was not nearly as good as the Toshiba in my house.  The signal strength was excellent for all local channels, so that was not an factor.  One of the daytime network shows had particularly bad audio.  The two women in the room commented that the sound was tinny.  While that is not a technical term that means very much, there was definitely some distortion that affected the sound quality.  I do not believe has anything to do with the quality of the speakers or their mounting within the chassis as them appear to be no better or worse than others I have seen.  The audio quality seemed better when a DVD was played.  The audio level was so low that the volume setting had to be above 80 for the smaller-than-usual viewing area.  I tried turning off the Dolby Audio Compression and there seemed to be some improvement in audio quality, but the level dropped so much that I turned it off in order to retain adequate sound level.  There is a digital audio output on the set, but no analog output.  It seems a significant design blunder not to include an analog audio output on a set that is targeted to those looking for a set with limited connectivity to replace an old CRT TV.The audio on this set is worse than the 'nothing-special' CRT TV it replaces.  If I happened to purchased it for my house, it would be on its way back to Amazon by now.  As of a few days ago, there were no firmware of hardward updated that might correct this problem.
