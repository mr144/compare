I must start off that Amazon has excellent customer service.  This TV/DVD Combo was the first of electronics i bought from Amazon.  The unit stopped working after only watching it a few times. So i cannot recommend this Toshiba 19SLV411U 19-Inch 720p 60 Hz LED HDTV with Built-in DVD Player.  I was plenty surprised since this brand is known for good quality and this could have been just a fluke thing. However, i am incredibly satisfied w/ Amazon's return/exchange policy & their amazing friendly service. (I had to return it with a movie stuck inside the player)but oh well.  I am sure i can find another TV.
