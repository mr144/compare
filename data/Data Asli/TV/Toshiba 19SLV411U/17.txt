Purchased this 19 inch to use in our camper. After using it just a few times volume went out. Customer service at Toshiba contacted and we tried a reset with no improvement. A few hours later TV/DVD quit working altogether with my DVD stuck in it. It has been returned for repair or replacement.Will update review when unit is returned to me.Update: TV returned after 3 weeks with new motherboard installed. So far no issues with the volume. It is still not has loud as I would like but at least it works and you can hear it in a loud rainstorm.I hope this one last longer then the 6 months for the first one.
