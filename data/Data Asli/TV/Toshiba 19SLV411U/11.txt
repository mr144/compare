I bought this TV for my son Christmas 2011 & it is not working anymore. It did not even last a year. The picture went out but still had sound. I disconnected it and when I turned it on, the sound was gone too & it would shut itself off. The technicians were helpful but the problem was NOT resolved. It is under warranty, but now I have to pay for shipping to get it repaired. Why should I have to pay for a defective product? We also have a JVC & a Sony TV that have NEVER given us any problems and we have had them for many years. I would NOT recommend a Toshiba.
