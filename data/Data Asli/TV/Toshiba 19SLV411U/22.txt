Bought this for my wife as a Christmas present. First one I received was dead on arrival. Returned to Amazon. Replacement unit stopped working after 30 days. Be prepared to spend lots of time on hold with Toshiba. Still working on returning 2nd unit to them as it failed just after return window at Amazon expired. Avoid this TV. It is only headaches. Wish I had bought something else.
