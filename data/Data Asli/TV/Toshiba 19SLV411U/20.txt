... TV/DVD combo stopped working.  Power on and it goes into stand-by (solid red light).  Manual was no help and talking to Toshiba directly required an extra dose of blood pressure meds.  Long story short, I have to pay for shipping and hope that they can repair it.  Also hope they return the DVD movie that is currently stuck in the combo set.Update:  Spent 45 minutes on hold last night with Toshiba.  Disconnected twice with both times never getting an RA# or address to return.  Tonight, on my 4th call with Toshiba (2 hours).  Disconnected 3 times.  Finally got a RA# but when it came to get an address to return, disconnected.  This is my last attempt.  Never, EVER, will I purchase another Toshiba product!!
