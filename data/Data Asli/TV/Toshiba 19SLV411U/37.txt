I needed a small TV/DVD combo for our guest bedroom,already have a larger Toshiba in MBR,so this 19' seemed to be the best choice.Shipped quickly from Amazon,was in great shape,easy to set up and were extremely pleased with it!Mind what some folks say that the sound is not the greatest but for a small room,it fits the bill!It is HD with 720p but picture is still good and DVD's look great.Price from Amazon plus free shipping was great.Just could not resist the 'order now button'.Very satisfied.
