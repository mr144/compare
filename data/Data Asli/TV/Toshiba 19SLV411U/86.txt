I  have a Sony 40' LCD Model: KDL40EX500  that I bought in Febuary for $899.00 playing side by side with my $399.00 Toshiba and much to my surprise my Toshiba has a better picture and equal sound dynamics to my Sony!!! Very, Very pleased with this purchase. I am going to purchase another Toshibia 40E210U  to place next to my other Toshibia 40E210U and move my Sony to my office.
