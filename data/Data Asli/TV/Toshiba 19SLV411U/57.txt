I bought this TV for use in my home office.  It's the perfect size, user friendly and has a great picture.  I can see how one may be disappointed in the audio.  This TV is the worst. If you are looking for TV sound that booms across a room, this is not the one for you.  But for my purposes (on the corner of my desk while I am working), it is just fine.
