TV arrived with no problems.  Great TV - beautiful picture, nice remote, and decent sound.  We hung ours on a bracket and it was easy.  This is a great TV for the price and will hold its own against others costing much more.  It's not as thin as the newer LED LCD models but so what!  You will not go wrong with this model.
