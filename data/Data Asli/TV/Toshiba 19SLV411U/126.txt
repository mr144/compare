I had this TV for awhile and nothing is wrong with it.  It serves everything I would expect from a TV.  It has a variety of number of input and output connections. I hook everything up to it. Cable TV, game systems, computer, DVD, Blue-Ray, etc.  Picture is clear as a 720P from a HD source can give.  I do not know why people complain about the sound.  Unless I have super hearing or everyone else is deaf, I hardly ever need to turn the volume up more than 1/4 of the way and it sounds good.  Plus there is always the option to hook it up to an audio system if you want.  Oh, okay, it does not have headphone jacks.  Come to think of it.  I have not even seen a TV around these days with headphone jacks so that is the last thing I look for in a TV.  Anyways, that problem is simply solved with a RCA adapter for your headphones that you can plug into the RCA input.
