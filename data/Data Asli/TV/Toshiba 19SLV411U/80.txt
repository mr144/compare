I was hesitant to purchase this tv because of all the negative reviews about the volume. I took a dive and I am very satisfied. It may be a little quieter than other tv's but, I am listening to it as I type at a comfortable 8 out of a 100. Maybe it could have more bass but other than that, I can deal with it for the money.
