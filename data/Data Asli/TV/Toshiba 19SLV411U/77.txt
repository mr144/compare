2/29/12- Just received the Toshiba 40' LCD TV yesterday and it does have a nice bright picture and is relatively easy to set up(I have it on the base standing up simply screw in 4 screws). Looks nice with the glossy black finish.  I moved up from an Emmerson 32inch 1080p LCD TV to this.**FIRST Impression**After setting up I turned the unit on to a high def. channel and the picture is good, nice and crisp; however, when I turn it up I immediately notice the sound being super tinny with no bass.  I expected the sound to not be great after reading several reviews, most of the flat panels I have owned have had OK sound, nothing great.  This TV is by far the worse sound out of the 3 different brands I have owned, but it does go up to 100 volume level and I have no problems hearing it, its just very tinny like I said.  I have read this in the reviews so no big surprise and I am currently shopping a sound bar, which I recommend to make this tv complete.  I was surprised my little 32 inch Emmerson had better sound but oh well.Overall I like the TV and for the money you can not get a name brand TV this size, unless its black friday or some kind of clearance sale and I would rather have a Toshiba brand TV than a Sceptre, Hisense, Coby, or any other off brands that are in this price range.---I will check in and update after I have gotten some more use out of it. Thanks and I hope this helps!******UPDATE******After having a little while I am noticing a little blur and mismatched sound, frame rate is only 60, but my 32 inch had a crisp picture so I am not used to the common LCD blurring problems. For 399 I am not complaining.******Newer Update*******Been watching a lot of tv and bluray movies and some gaming.  The blu-ray looks like crap compared to my old 32 inch emmerson from walmart and the high def channels on my direct tv look blurry and not crisp.  Kind of regretting going cheap, and wish I had a nice clear picture like my old 32 inch.  Do not buy if you are used to high end tvs, however if its your first I am sure you will enjoy.  Just wished it had a better picture
