This 18.5-inch set was shipped to me packed only in the factory box, but UPS got it here in perfect condition.  Its picture could not be sharper, and the sound seems good.  There is a printed setup guide included, but you have to download and print the 62-page Owner's Manual yourself from the Toshiba.com website.  That's a necessity, as the 19SL410U is packed with features and adjustments, and Toshiba's corner cutting is the only reason it does not earn five stars.
