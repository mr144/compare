The product works well most of the time.  It's GETTING IT TO WORK that is sometimes a problem.  When it is first turned on, it shows the picture, but sometimes makes a VERY strange sound.  Almost like crackling or -- well, all I can think of is 2 of some kind of metal rubbing against each other.  When I turn it off and then on again, it is fine.  Otherwise, I like it just fine.
