The TOSHIBA combo TV/DVD player, (all sizes)  are the WORST!! I have purchased (3) of them, all under warranty more currently known as a 'WORST' BUY!!!! All 3 of these tv/combos, fail miserably in the DVD department. The DVD fails, freezes, holds the DVD and will not release it. I bought the larger sized one, 1st and now have a 24' DVD/tv combo. This one does exactly the same thing as the bigger one.The sound is terrible, the DVD/TV combo is terrible, not worth the $$ the gas to haul it back and forth to return it or the aggravation!!TOSHIBA, requires 2+ weeks to decide whether to repair or not, they do not give a Loaner tv, while they are mucking around  deciding what to do with the crummy one. I was cautioned, not to purchase this combo product, by an electronics salesperson and did not listen to them. This is an awful product, as unreliable as anything...DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!
