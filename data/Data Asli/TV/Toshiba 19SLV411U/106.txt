Do not waste your money spend the extra 90 dollars and get a sony or something else. The first day I bought it home I connected the hdmi and got no signal that should have been a sign to take it right back. This TV is worse than sony, panasonic, samsung, sharp, sony, tcl or vizio. I did get the ports working for 2 weeks but now both ports stopped working. I took it right back to Best Buy and got a sony. Took the sony home hooked up the hdmi and bam it works. Toshiba did offer to send a tech out but I was still within timeframe to return the tv luckily. Now maybe I just got a bad set but the new tv came with an actual manual and a much better remote
