There are a lot of good 19' HDTVs out there - and this is not one of them. As mentioned by all - the audio is a joke. I just bought a small, cheap power amp & speakers to make up for it - and apparently you still need adapters & cables to accomplish that. So much for space saving. Also - it might be an optical illusion, but the Sony 19' TV in my kitchen looks bigger than this unit. Probably due to having working speakers in the front of the chassis. But the Toshiba really looks small - like laptop computer screen small. Picture is almost painfully sharp - but it does not like motion. Serious pixelation & annoying artifacts during action sequences - perhaps a characteristic of an LED monitor? I bought this for my wife's sewing room, she is somewhat less critical than me and wanted something with an integrated DVD player - and coupled with the hassle & expense of returning a perfectly functioning TV means we are keeping the unit. But I am not at all pleased with it is picture and the external audio headaches are going to balloon the price of this thing by another $100. Pass. Quickly.
