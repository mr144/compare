Great tv exelent HD screen, nice for gaming, I do not know why people say this tv sucks just because they got a defected one, or cry about the sound, I know the speakers are crap, but come on!! it is a 40' HDTV with great features like the delay control for the consoles, this tv would look good anywhere you put it, am in love with it, I replace it for my 22' HDTV and I love how big it is compare to my previous tv, the sound problem can be fix by just buying some speakers, here n amazon they have a lot of 2.1 speakers that sound good at a great at a price under 50 bucks, so stop crying abut some lack of hdmi, or bad sound, this tv it is a great buy for 400 bucks,  overall great for gaming, blue ray disck, as pc or Mac monitor,.. But in my case this would be for gaming and a monitor for my Mac mini,Update, the shipping from the seller was way too late from the estimate time!
