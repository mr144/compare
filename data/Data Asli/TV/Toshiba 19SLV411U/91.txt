The Tv works perfect, the resolution is great and have good features *usb port, 2 HDMI, pc port, in general I liked it, however, the sound was terrible, you definitely will get what you paid for, cheap Tv, cheap sound, I should had read the reviews before purchasing it...You will not encounter any issues if you have a home theater installed on the room.
