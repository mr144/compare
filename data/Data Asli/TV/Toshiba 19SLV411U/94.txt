After a long time waiting and searching and waiting I finally pulled the trigger on this TV.  The sound is pretty poor as other reviewers have stated but I run our sound through the stereo system so it did not really matter.  Picture is very good, especially for the price.  Good contrast and not a lot of fade when viewing from the side. If I used the sound I would likely have considered sending it back.  But it is the perfect TV for what we use it for.
