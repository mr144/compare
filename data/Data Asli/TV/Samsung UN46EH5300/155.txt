Samsung is really killing the competition now with these quality products.  This TV is so easy to set up and use.  The picture is fantastic with deep black color.  Not even a hint of grey.  Streaming is fast and rarely has any hiccups.  Very satisfied.  This one does not have the hand gesture commands however, because it has no camara.  You have to pay more for that feature.
