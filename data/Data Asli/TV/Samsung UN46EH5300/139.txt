I was a bit worried to buy this online.. but it is great ..The picture quality and sound everything seems amazing..Good things about it are..good number of HDMI ports.. and picture quality is excellent.I did not like the smart apps as it just tests your patience..to open.. and when watching something on Youtube.. all of a sudden it hangs.. and does not buffer any more.. so you need to go and stream it again..If you have good bandwidth for internet..go for it.. otherwise normal LED TV with USB ports is good.. connect your laptop to it and watch it without any disturbance..You can stream videos from you Iphone to Youtube by Pairing devices.. the feature is good.. but does not work that great if you do not have good wi-fi support..Overall I like it.. and yes for the same amount I was getting a normal LED TV.. so preferred to get a smart TV.Worth to take it for the amount it has..The TV as such has good apps and features.. you need to blame the ISP.. for poor streaming.. :)
