Perfect addition to my kitchen.Pros: Lots of solid features for the money.  Picture quality, colors and backlighting look great.  Smart TV features are very nice, Netflix, HBO Go, Weather Apps work perfectly over wireless-N network in my house.  There is a lot of bad reviews on Samsung's Smart TV features, however I find it to be great and similar to the competition.Cons: Samsung Smart TV starts slowly and does not offer much for apps.  Youtube's Samsung app is lagging behind other competitors.  Pretty much the same as Roku. Wish the selection was similar to Amazon Apps or Google Play.
