I gave this product 1 year, thinking that I may be able to figured out how to use this product, thinking may be I was missing something.  Oh NO!  I was missing something, Samsung missing a lot of things:  1. Amazon app does not work at all 2. Web browser does not work well at all even when I go to amazon.com (it cannot load the movie I rented from Amazon after paying to watch the movie)  3. Television does not have enough &#34;Power&#34; to run internet shows such as Bloomberg, Ed Show, or Rachel Maddow 4. Television said that the television does not have enough memory to watch things on the internet.Meanwhile, I paid and bought this TV because of these things advertised on it.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TV BECAUSE YOU ARE ONLY GOING TO WASTE YOUR MONEY.
