Disappointed in lack of support for .MOV video formats...  However, Picture quality very good and has a great set of features...IT DOES NOT SUPPORT .MOV VIDEO FORMATS!!!  The main reason that I purchased this 'Smart' TV was to connect to my NAS (network hard drive) and play my videos for family and friends.  I take all of my videos with an awesome Cannon PowerShot SX230 HS which stores video in the .MOV format...  What a BIG disappointment when I found that this 'Smart' TV does not support this format.If you intend on using your 'Smart' TV to play this popular video format look to a manufacture other than Samsung.  AND verify before you buy!
