Very good picture and good sound. The initial Smart Hub/internet connection setup is quite easy, probably 15 minutes, you must navigate an on-screen keyboard using the remote control for the setup. The usual input is required: date, time, router password, etc. Connection speed thru the hub to establish a stable, wireless link is often slow, 10-20 seconds, not as fast as the typical laptop takes to log on to the internet. Once connected, streaming is quite good with our cable internet provider, maybe a few pauses during a full length movie. I think there can be multiple reasons for an intermittent wireless link, and wireless download speed can be quite variable depending on traffic, so I can not fault the TV for the pauses. We have been using the TV since Christmas 2012, and so far so good.
