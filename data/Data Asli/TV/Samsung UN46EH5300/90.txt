It is not as smart as it is described. It takes over two hours to keep downloading the upgrade files and seek the wireless. Finally, I can use it to surf web, but the remote controller is really hard to use to key in an URL. And, because it is a Linux operation system, the video driver is out of date to support the Adobe video playing software!!! Can I add a wireless keyboard or mouse on this TV? Samsung does not tell us on the manual!
