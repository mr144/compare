We have had our TV for about 3 months now and we love it!  It was very easy to set up and easy to figure out how to use The Hub. (center where all of your apps are shown)  We have had no problems at all with this product.  We also (just for fun) found and app for our smart phones that allows our phone to act as a TV remote!  This is kind of cool because you can type letter in various search boxes etc instead of having to use arrows to move a cursor along a keyboard on the screen.
