I mounted my Samsung Smart TV on my bedroom wall and had it up and running within minutes. All you need to do is plug it into a power outlet and you are ready to go. It already has all the most popular apps embedded in it (i.e. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Vudu, HBO Go, ESPN, MLB) and there are dozens more available for download. It literally took me two minutes to get the TV setup on my home wireless LAN network and I was able to immediately start streaming movies and TV shows. The picture and sound were already at ideal levels for me so I did not need to spend hours tinkering around. I highly recommend this TV as it certainly  meets the high standards that Samsung has set for their products. After buying and using this 32&#34; for my bedroom I am now planning to buy a larger one for my living room.
