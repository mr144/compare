Giving this five stars because its awesome- the big (king size) is exactly what I need- the size fits perfectly in our living room- the black color is very neutral and does not get dirty-  smart technology is good, we do not use it as much because of apple tv- having the wifi is a really great nice to have- looks very promising as far as reliability is concern- style is very simple and great- does the job 100%- this one is the tv! the best in its size and price range
