This is a great tv for the price point. I looked for over a year for a smart tv that was 40 inches and under $500. Smart tv apps and Internet work great. Picture and colors of the tv look very authentic. My only issue with the tv and it is pretty minor is that the sound on it is not great. I am in a small apartment so it does not bother me too much but in a larger room you may need to invest in some larger speakers.Also, if you have an iPhone download the samsung tv remote app. Communicates with tv wirelessly so you can change channel and volume from another room without having to point remote phone directly at tv. Pretty cool.
