I got this TV a couple of days ago so I could watch movies without HDMI cable going from PC to TV.  Guess what, this TV does not support flash so I can not stream most movies.  Not so smart.The picture is great (use the settings recommended in the Amazon review section) and you can use a Logitech K400 wireless keyboard so you do not have to type using remote.It just does not make sense that you can not see Flash content.  If I have to buy WIDI connection, I should have just kept my old TV and saved the money.
