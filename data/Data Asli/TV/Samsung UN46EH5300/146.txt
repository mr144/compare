I bought this TV for the simplest of reasons: to watch DVDs (I am canceling cable and using the $50 a month cable bill savings to pay for this) in my bedroom. I was watching a 15' CRT--seriously. I saw this in use in a restaurant and asked the bartender for the model number. The TV looked incredible in the darkened restaurant and it looks just as great in my bedroom. I can not talk at all about things like the wireless capability or the lack of Skype on this model, I simply do not care. This TV's picture is fantastic, the sound is great (but I am adding a set of speakers anyway) and the set up (I hate setting up TVs) was relatively painless.If you are buying this, shop around for price and do what I did: tell the manager you'll buy it immediately and pay cash if he'll knock off 15% off the price--he countered with 10% and I bought it on the spot.Who knows how long it will last, but for the price, a great 40' TV. And I am using it with a $29 Philips dvd player :)
