We have experience with a 58&#34; Samsung plasma HDTV before buying this 32&#34; LED version for our dining room.  It is a great set and a fantastic buy, was easy to set up and program, produces a crisp and clear picture, the perfect size for viewing from 5 ft to 8 ft.  Like most all LED sets, viewing from an angle decreases the clarity and brilliance as compared to plasma.  But the blacks on this LED are sharp and motion (ie: NASCAR or golf shots) cause no blurring.  Sound quality and volume are superb.  We have not learned the set's SMART capabilities yet but have used the wifi connectivity and are very pleased.  I did recommend this to anyone who is looking for a set to support a medium sized room where viewing distance is no more than 10 ft away.
