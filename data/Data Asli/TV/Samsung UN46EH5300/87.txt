Great reception on TV, when I took the advice of one of the reviews on how to set the picture settings. I also took the advice of one of the reviews to buy a Logitech keyboard to work the web browse! Believe me when I say that it is much to tedious to use the remote that comes with the tv!!! I am still just learning all the great apps that come witn it! Between the excellent quality of the tv reception,  web browseing and huge selection of helpful and enjoyable apps, this is an excellent buy at $599 dollars! !!
