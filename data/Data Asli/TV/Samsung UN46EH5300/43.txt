I bought this TV to go in the bedroom. Since we did not want to pay for a second DVR box or buy an Apple TV or Roku we went with this one. I have to say the last 2 months with the TV have been great. There have been a few glitches and small annoyances but overall very few complaints.  The glitches are as follows: a few times the TV did not want to connect to wifi- the simple solution was to turn it off and back on and it works normal again. The TV also adjusts to the brightness in the room which is great but sometimes at an odd daylight hour it adjusts up and down for a good 30 seconds.  The only real complaint is the remote, which could have been redesigned for the smart tv capabilities. However, there are iOS apps you can download to control the TV which is a really cool workaround. So if you are looking to watch Netflix and Hulu on your TV and do not want the extra box sitting on your stand this is a great choice.
