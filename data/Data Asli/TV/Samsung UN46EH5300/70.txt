This is replacing our older Samsung and boy is it fannnntastic.  Clarity is just excellent, sound is not so bad, but we did have a bar speaker so that helped quite a bit.  Set up was as easy as ABC. Loved the idea that it will start and shut down your Bluray after insert & disc removal.  Too much good stuff here, would not have room to list it all.  Buy it and you'll love it! The only downside is that this Smart TV is so much smarter than we are.  Oh well that's technology for you.
