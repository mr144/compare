Others have written adequate reviews for which I can add little. Rather, this review is a comment on Amazon's customer service.I ordered my 46-inch Samsung UN46EH5300 late evening on a Tuesday, it arrived the following Friday. Unfortunately, the box was creased and the TV's screen had a 3-inch fracture (something like a spiderweb break). I got online immediately and followed Amazon's quite painless return/reorder process. Remarkably, when UPS arrived Monday to pickup the broken TV, they delivered the replacement at the same time.Trust me, I was not happy when the first TV arrived broken, but Amazon certainly went the extra distance in having my replacement delivered within two days.As for the TV I could not be happier. It was easy to setup and the Smart Hub is terrific.
