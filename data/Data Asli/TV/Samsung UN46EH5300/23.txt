I feel like I am living in the furture. This tv is indeed smart. With a click of a button I am streaming tv or on the internet. I love it. It was easy to set up in minutes. The picture is sharp and clear. We put it in the bedroom for night time and early morning viewing. We have Direct TV and it hooked up quickly , came right on.
