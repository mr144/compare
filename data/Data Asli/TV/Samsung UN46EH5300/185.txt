Pretty cool television so far, at first when I tried watching cable and movies I was horrified by the poor image. I soon learned that my cable box was not HD, replacing it for a high-def model fixed that. I also realized the poor image from movies was because I was using DVD's (the 480p resolution is stretched out to the 50&#34; screen, making it look bad), so I upgraded my Netflix plan to Blu-ray and it is looking good!The Netflix instant feature has worked well for me and Wii U/ PS3 games look fantastic.In other words, be prepared to upgrade any old devices/media you use to HD to get the best image out of this TV.
