There are a number of things we really like about this TV. The picture quality is great and you can view it at pretty extreme angles. We purchased it for use in an RV and we wanted one that could be viewed from various angles. The trim around the TV is narrow which allowed it to fit in the space that we had. We love the ability to access wireless networks so we can use Mazon Prime while on the road.
