Samsung is the only TV (and cell phone) I will buy. Easy setup. Once you learn how to work one, the next time you buy one they are virtually the same product as far as volume, picture, child block, etc.Excellent TV for the money. Just be sure to get a wireless keyboard and mouse so when you use NetFlix, FaceBook or Amazon you do not have to use the remote to &#34;type&#34;.
