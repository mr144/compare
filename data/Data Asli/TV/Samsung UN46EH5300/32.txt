Buyer beware!  Though this TV is listed as being 120Hz, it is actually 60Hz.  Samsung has labeled it as '120 Clear Motion Rate (CMR)', which is probably the source of the confusion.  I purchased this TV looking for a good deal on a Samsung, seeing as they typically have great panels.  After receiving the set and setting it up, I quickly noticed that the motion was not as smooth as my Vizio 120Hz set.  A little bit of internet research (along with the fact that the TV does not say 120Hz anywhere on the box, or on Samsung's website) led me to the knowledge that Amazon has this TV mislabeled.  I returned the TV, and requested that the labeling be fixed.  The picture quality is great otherwise, but it is frustrating having to return an otherwise great product due to a labeling error.  Bad form Amazon...
