We have always had Sony TVs...until now.  I have owned this model for 3 months and so far I am extremely pleased by the amazing clarity of the picture and even more pleased by the easy access to Netflix and Hulu.  This has eliminated having to set up a DVD player, for now anyway.  I now own 2 of these TVs and have no regrets. It's Samsung from here on in- sorry Sony.
