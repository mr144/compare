Have had a plasma set for a while and thought I did test the waters with an LED, since my 14-month old Panasonic recently suffered the '7 flashes of death.' But that's a different story.Well, after one day with this 40' LED it is clear to me that technology has yet to address the viewing angle issue of LEDs. There is not much else to say here, because I am not much interested on how 'smart' a TV is; I simply want a great picture. And this TV does deliver a GREAT picture--BUT ONLY if you are sitting directly in front of the TV and you do not lean over to either side. I was shocked at how drastically the colors and contrast are mangled when you are watching just a few degrees off-center axis,  both horizontally as well as vertically! I can not tell you exactly how many degrees it takes to notice integrity loss of the picture but it seems like it is as little as about 15 degrees off center at a viewing distance of about 6-7 feet. At about 45 degrees, forget about it! Not sure if viewing distance is a factor.So, unless you are a hermit and or a complete loner who always watches TV alone, or only plays games on this TV alone, you will often notice the quality of the picture take a serious nose-dive as soon as you stand up to go to the kitchen or lean over to whisper sweet nothings into your girlfriend's ear.I am giving it a generous 3 stars because, like I said, if you are watching head-on it is easily a 5 star rating from me.I will be returning this LED set once my Panasonic is fixed. There seem to be no other choices out there right now other than a plasma, I am discovering, if picture is your #1 priority.
