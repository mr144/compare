This TV was purchased because it is wifi enabled for netflix. It performs well. It is installed near workout machines. unfortunately the volume at maximum is not sufficient to overpower the roar and whine of home Gym equipment. The pictures are clear, installation was snap and it fitted easily into an existing overhead wall bracket. The included Remote control is easy enough to work with. The wifi set up is a no brainer. I deduct a star for the volume. Other reviews of this product had already highlighted the volume issue, so within a couple of weeks I ordered some speakers which sorted out the issues.
