The picture quality is great on this. The form factor is very nice; I like the thin bezel. The sound is not great, but is not bad; certainly sufficient. Netflix runs great over the wifi on it, and the interface to get to stuff like Netflix is easy to use and intuitive. Finally it was easy to mount to the wall. So, I have no complaints so far. I really like this TV and would recommend it to anyone looking at 32 inch HDTVs.
