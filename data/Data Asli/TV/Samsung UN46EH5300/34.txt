I use a dish and did not upgrade to HD. The first unit had a cracked screen and just one Email got another unit on the third day. It is very easy to set up with your router/wireless system (I am 64 and not computer savvy) for internet use. Another reviewers numbers for setting the picture worked great..This replaced a Sony CRT and the only disappointment is the sound which is really weak. It does have an optical out on the back for a soundbar so I am researching that. Make sure you know your full system or you may not be able to connect the soundbar/home theater you have. I have watched movies off the net and it works well although you do not get them in HD. I did a lot of research on features and price before buying and feel I got the best value for the price. I am patient enough to wait for a good deal on a soundbar/home theater system to improve the sound or I may get used to it.The Samsung site does not give you any compatibility charts for the TV and soundbars.
