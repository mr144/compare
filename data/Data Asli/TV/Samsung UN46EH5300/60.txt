Quality is superb and it was a very easy setup without any trouble. It's also very handy for USB usage and that was a plus since my fianc&eacute; and I watch a lot of shows from our portable media devices. I additionally like the auto adjust of brightness feature at night because it allows me to enjoy television without an excess of brightness when I am tired. The Smart TV apps are enjoyable and makes it easy to link your accounts like MLB TV or premium music/movie subscription services. All in all, I could not imagine getting any other brand because I have all been impressed by Samsung electronics and this television purchase is not something I will regret buying!
