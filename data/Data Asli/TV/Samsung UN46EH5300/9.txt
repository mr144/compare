I read other reviews about this model but was hoping I would not experience the same issue.  Out of the box, set the TV up in my bedroom, and the TV kept turning 'off' on its own!  Called Samsung and I did have to take it about 15 miles to a repair shop (under warranty).  Since many others on here stated they had this constant 'turns itself OFF' flaw with this model, I am returning it via UPS tomorrow.If there is good news, the picture looked great and Amazon.com handles returns quickly via this website.
