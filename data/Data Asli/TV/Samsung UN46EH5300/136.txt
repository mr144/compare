I set this up using a conponent video cable from my satellite receiver - component to componentI noticed the set becoming a little dim, picture quality reduced, and would come back again, and quality reduced.The user's manual says: &#34;for better picture quality we recommend the component connection over the A/V connection.When you connect a video cable to Component/AV IN the color of the Component?AV IN (VIDEO) jack (green) will not match the video color cable (yellow)Could someone fully explain this to me.Clerview
