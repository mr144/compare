I bought this TV last year. I have no complaints with the quality of the picture extra. The thing that drives me to write this review is the smart hub. I use the smart hub mostly to watch Netflix and the amount of issues I had to deal with has led me to buy a new streaming device for this TV. The issues that I have with SmartHub are1. I have to enter my account information every few days.2. I have to connect to my wireless network every few months.3. Once I connect to Netflix I have to dismiss an error on average 5 times before I can watch anything.4. Finally the most frustrating thing, the whole TV restarts in the middle of watching a movie on Netflix.The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that I do not have to do any of this any of the time for my Roku Player. I am a software engineer by profession and i know what is going to happen if I call Samsung, I will be sent from Samsung to Netflix to my ISP. Bottomline, I do not have a problem getting Netflix to work with any other device excepts Samsung, so I think Samsung must be doing something wrong. Do not buy this TV for the SmartHub.
