I regret getting rid of my Roku before I had lived with the 'smart' tv for a while. Yes, it has Netflix and Amazon, but the whole experience of using them is miserable:1. The TV always boots up to  didumb' mode and you must push the button for Smart Hub, which takes about 30 seconds to load.2. It does not have any memory of what you used last, so now I have to select Netflix (apparently, my TV thinks I should exercise more because it always starts up on 'Fitness')3. The Netflix and Amazon apps are painfully bad compared to a Roku. They are slow to load, the responsiveness is slow, and they randomly freeze up.4. The Smart Hub has updated itself about 10 times in the three weeks I have had the TV.5. There are about a dozen different apps taking up screen real estate for the sole purpose of selling you content, like Your Video, Fitness and Kids.6. Nothing is integrated. Every app has a different one-screen keyboard, none of them can make use of a USB keyboard (although the TV itself can for a few things). Every app has a completely different UI.If I had not given my Roku away with the CRT TV I replaced I would have just hooked it up. The whole Samsung experience feels like trying to navigate a web site filled with ads where every click takes you to a popup.Ignoring the smart TV features, this is a pretty good TV. The picture, sound, build quality, and remote are all what I expected. It is slow to switch channels, but that seems to be common now that everything's digital.
