I am pretty savvy with digital picture quality and appreciate the care in this set in getting good color and contrast. That does not help when I just want to turn on the show I was watching. Maybe it is this way with all new sets, but it takes several minutes just to get to anything streaming - not on cable.But we are happy with the wireless reception and someday will figure out how to get our computers that are on wireless to stream to this set as well. I did buy it again, no question.
