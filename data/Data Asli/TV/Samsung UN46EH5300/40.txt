We have purchased Samsung TV's before and liked the quality.  We were leery about purchasing one on the internet.  Our TV arrived on time, was easy to hook up, but there was our worst fear - a problem with the picture.  It was hard to see at first - it looked like the bottom half of a bull's eye target. Starting at the top of the screen going down were black half circles.  We called Samsung - who answered the phone!  No voice mail hell.  They asked us to take a picture of the screen and email it to them.  I was a little annoyed and they explained that if they could see what was wrong the repairman would have the part with him.  They worked with my schedule and sent a repairman to my house at my convenience.  The repairman came on time - had the right part & fixed the TV.  The customer service from Samsung was Stellar.  As for the TV itself - the audio and picture are very good.  Which rates it a 4 star.  But for the money - it is an excellent buy and is worth 5 stars.
