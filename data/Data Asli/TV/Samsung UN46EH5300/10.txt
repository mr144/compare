I was kind of excited at first, but what they don&#8217;t tell you is that when you&#8217;re are trying to view YouTube on your smart tv is does not work as expected, you can&#8217;t really view high definition videos on you tube, It does not work properly, I was very disappointed, other than that the tv works fine! I just have to figure out how to live with not watching You Tube on my tv.
