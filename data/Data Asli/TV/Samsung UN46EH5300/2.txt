got this to replace a 32' Vizio Smart Tv which i purchased from Amazon and returned it the next day...this Tv INSTANTLY found my Wifi, password put in and im surfing the web...awesome. set up was really simple and instructions were clear and precise...the 'smart hub' aspect of this tv is awesome and works great. it took about a hour to program all my apps...amazon, pandora, netflix, crackle, etc....but it was really easy. prob. best to have a laptop handy for this...the picture as it comes is OK...i looked at the first review here and used their guides and now it rocks....not sure of the sound, i use external speakers...the remote is OK...laid out well but not a fan of the layout but thats a personal preference...universal remote will be used.shipping and packaging was great.if anything should happen to change my review i will change it, but as it stands...i cannot recommend this tv enough. my first big boy tv and im glad i spent the extra money on a Samsung...the quality over the Vizio is without comparison, especially with the picture....this thing looks amazing.completely recommend, absolutely.p.s. do not try to adjust your tv setting whilst Nancy Grace is on...that lady has so many filters on you can never get it right.....lesson learned.
