I was looking for a TV for the bedroom.  After spending a lot of time comparing sizes, picture quality, and features I decided on this one mainly for the built-in wifi at a good price.  Picture is just as good as my older Viera (which I love).  So glad I ended up with the built-in wifi for an extra $50.  I use the Netflix app more on this TV than anything.  The picture is almost as good as a Bravia and a lot cheaper  (at least for the 32&#34; model).
