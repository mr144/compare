I just went through 3 very frustrating hours on the phone with Samsung, my cable provider and Amazon. The WORST was Samsung. They had me on hold for 57 minutes and could not resolve my problem but said I either had to drive the tv 2 hours for repair or return it. I called Amazon and they do not have any more of this model in stock if I wanted to exchange it. So consider yourself lucky you can not buy it. But if you do buy a Samsung product and need help - good luck talking to anybody that can resolve your issue. I will be going to an actual STORE to buy the LG smart tv and sending this junk back to Amazon. Flimsy stand too btw...
