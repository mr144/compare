This TV is awesome for the money.  It's super easy to hookup and paired up with our network at home easy. I would give it 5 stars but the only thing is the shipping.  The TV comes in the box just like to got it from a store and put it in your car.  However it did not arrive here from someones personal car it arrived by UPS the box was quite banged up with some tears in the box.  I am hoping that nothing has happened to it during shipping that will show up later.  But for now its working great and could not be happier with it.
