Have been using this TV since last 6 months. I read extensive review of the item before purchasing it. So far it has been perfect. The only thing that I wish could be improved was the UI which is a bit clunky esp. when you want to type something in your browser. But since I have the Samsung Galaxy S3, the All Play Android app has been extremely useful to input the text in the browser URL. But before purchasing I knew this drawback and hence still giving it a 5 star.
