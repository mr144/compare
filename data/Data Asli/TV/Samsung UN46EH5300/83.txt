Absolutely great picture for this size TV (and I have a gorgeous 50&#34; Pioneer Elite downstairs, so I do want something nice).  What I really do not like is the internet access/web browsing experience. We have another tv that has a remote with a pointer which is soooo much easier rather than holding down the &#34;enter&#34; button until the pointer gets to the letter you want to select. Then God forbid, you select the wrong button and exit and you are back at square one. I just do not like the internet experience on this tv.But overall the setup was a breeze, anyone can do it.  The picture out of the box was great (I am sure someone with more technical skills could make it better, but it is good enough for a bedroom tv), sound is totally fine.  I love the TV for every day viewing.
