I love this TV!!!! I listen to Pandora and my radio morning show on it.  I love having Netflix and all the apps that are available to download.  I do not have the cable hooked up to it and am debating whether or not I will even get to that part.  This TV is lightweight and very easy to set up.  Definitely worth buying!!!
