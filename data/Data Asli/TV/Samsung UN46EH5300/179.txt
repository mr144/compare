Bought this TV a little over a month ago for the bedroom. One of the main reasons for selecting this one was on/off timer, there are not alot of TVs with this feature. Your able to have to TV turn on at a preset time tuned to a desired channel and volume. You can actually have multiple on/off settings. Picture and sound quality are good, maybe not the best out there. There are a good selection of apps, Netfilx works well. The only disappointing thing is when streaming videos from a media server you cannot fastforward. But all in all a very good Smart TV for the price.
