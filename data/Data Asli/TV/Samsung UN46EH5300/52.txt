I have been happy with all the Samsung Smart TVs I have purchased. The only drawbacks I find is the built in wireless could be stronger and the Web Browser needs a total revamp. I have to use an EOP in order to stream movies from my network because the wireless is not stable enough. I can stream to my wireless laptops no problem. This is an issue with a lot of Wireless TVs from many manufacturers. You might as well stick a needle in your eye than use the built in web browser. Even my bigger Samsung with the keyboard remote is very bad. This model fixed issues they had with indexing DLNA and portable hard drives is seems but I have not played heavily around with it yet.
