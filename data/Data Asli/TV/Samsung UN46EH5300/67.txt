WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT SAMSUNG EXCEPT EXCELLENCE.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN A BETTER PICTURE.  IT'S INCREDIBLY CLEAR AND VIBRANT.  I WOULD SAY LG IS A CLOSE SECOND.  I WOULDN'T BOTHER WITH ANY OTHER  BRANDS.  I HAVE HEARD ABOUT ISOLATED INSTANCES WITH THE TV'S , BUT IT'S NEVER AN ISSUE ACROSS THE BOARD. 5 YEARS FROM NOW, THEY WILL REDUCE THE PRICE OF THE LATEST MODELS: I.E., FULL ARRAY LED, 240HZ REFRESH RATE,  LESS THAN .5 INCH THICKNESS,  6 HDMI INPUTS PLUS A FEW OUTPUTS, ETC. UNTIL THEN, THIS WILL SERVE THE PURPOSE.
