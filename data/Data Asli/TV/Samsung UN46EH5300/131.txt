My larger Samsung TV downstairs has some difficulties with smart features (or at least I have difficulties.)  The two blu-rays(Samsung) have difficulties connecting with Netflix.  This however is simple and streams effortlessly.  Now I can get my wife to start watching Breaking Bad.  Oh year the screen is high quality no pixelating.
