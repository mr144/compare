We love Warehouse deals....bought this as a replacement for an older model Samsung LCD TV used for our little Granddaughters.  Great color. WiFi was a synch to set up, apps work well.  We have a higher end larger 3D Sammy LED which has a faster response time, but for the $$$ this is a great little TV.
