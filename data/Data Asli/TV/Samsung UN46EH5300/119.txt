We purchased this TV for our bedroom....researched and shopped around everywhere and Amazon offered the best price for the most features. Great picture and surprisingly good sound for a flat screen....but the smart features are what gave this set 5 stars. We use a Roku system on a living room tv, but with the Samsung Smart TV we can stream our favorite channels, connect to the internet,watch tons of movies,etc. without purchasing any other devices!....Thanks Amazon for the heads up on the need of just 1 HDMI cable for about $6 to make the magic happen....Love our new Samsung Smart Tv and love Amazon service and delivery!!!
