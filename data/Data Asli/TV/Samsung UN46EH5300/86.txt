Bought this TV in Dec 2012 and 4 months later the SmartHub connects when it feels like and the TV turns off and on after 5 mins repeatedly. Updated the firmware, it worked for a day and it did the same thing all over again. Every 5 mins off and on . . . off and on . . . . off and on. Buyers beware of 'Smart TVs' I would give this technology a couple more years. I own 3 other Samsung TVs with no issues.
