I researched this TV with Consumer Reports and three other sites. I looked at pricing with the military, Best-Buy, Crutchfield and Walmart. Amazon had the right price.The best advantage is that its can tie into your wifi system - few others can.Samsung makes great products.Would I buy it again - MOST definitely.
