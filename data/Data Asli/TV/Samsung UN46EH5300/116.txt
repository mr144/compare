The settings can be found in a ton of other reviews.  I think this TV is great and the internet connectivity is pretty slick.  I connected the TV, it updated its software and the smart hub software right away. Menus are easy to understand and there are a lot of settings.  This TV is BRIGHT! The Youtube app works pretty well, my wife was impressed with the continuous play of all the videos of our daughter.My only gripes are A) mine did NOT come with a remote with a keyboard like the larger screen sizes does and B) THE ANDROID REMOTE APP IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SAMSUNG'S CURRENT FLAGSHIP PHONE THE GALAXY S3.  I hope they update this soon. The app on my tablet works pretty well.  Set up was easy and linked right away.
