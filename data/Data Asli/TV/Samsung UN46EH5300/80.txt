I selected this TV based on the reviews, the price and the size (ie, the height)I have had the TV for ~5 weeks.The picture is fine after some tweeking.  I use Dynamic mode during the day and Movie at night and adjusted several of the other parameters which I have not needed to change once they were set.The one issue I would caution about (that has been previously noted) its that the screen is very reflective.  I have windows opposite and to the side of the TV which I close to get the best picture.The stand is pretty flimsy and does not swivel but it is ok.The sound is fine for the price. When I listen to music I use the Music setting, otherwise Clear Voice.Setting it up to my cable box and DVD was easy. I was able to hook up to the internet, Netflix easily and I am far from a tecky.The first set I received from Amazon had a cracked screen.  Within 2 days they sent me a new one (which is fine) and picked up the old via UPS.
