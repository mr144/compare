We bought this Smart TV with a excitement of all the features that this tv has like web browser,Netflix,Youtube and many more. With in one day after receiving this product we started getting error while accessing SMART HUB. Even though we were connected to WIFI or wireless network it started throwing different errors like ERROR_CODE_01,ERROR_MODEL_BINd and many more.To add to this the web browser does not support many sites and is no good but you can use it just to read.Every time when we power off or switch on this tv the different error it used to throw for smart hub. WE have decided to return this TV and have already processed it.I request each one of you to think twice before buying this product and not get attracted to all the feature this tv has which of no use at all.........My opinion for this TV is &#34;DONT BUY THIS SMART HUB IT SUCS&#34;.Regardsmd176
