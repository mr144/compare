Really disappointed with this . . and I WANTED this TV (and usually love Amazon). But this experience was awful. Bought the TV, paid extra for expedited delivery b/c I knew I did be home on a Friday. Television arrived. . and when I pulled it out of the box, the screen had a huge crack across the front. Amazon quickly processed an exchange. . .but I had to make special arrangements to take off work for when the UPS guy picked up the package, and delivered the exchange.  Finally got it out of the box, looked fine, set it up, turned it on. . . the screen was flawed. A large circular space of the screen (top left) and corner of the screen (top right) was totally WHITE. Had to take it apart, pack it up, send it back. AGAIN, had to make special arrangements to be home for the pick up. Not a good experience at all.I thought I wanted this TV b/c it was rated well by c.net and by Consumer Reports. BUT if I can not get an undamaged one. . . Do not recommend ordering items like this from Amazon.UPDATE: I do want to note that Amazon did provide a full refund. And it was processed quickly.  But still do not have a TV. . . :(
