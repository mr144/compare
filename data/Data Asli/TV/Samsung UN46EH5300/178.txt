Smart hub ceases to work for long periods of time. Most of the time when I try to open the smart hub and connect to the internet, it never does and then  the  TV turns off  and after a few seconds turns back on. To make things worse it keeps turning off and  on several times. Occasionally the smart hub opens but it does not recognize the wi-fi signal. I managed to go back to the original setting and it worked well fot a few hours then  it went back to  doing the same thing. I am very dissapointed.
