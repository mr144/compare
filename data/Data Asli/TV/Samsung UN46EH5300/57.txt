I specifically selected this Samsung model for a bedroom TV because it has the Wi-Fi smart TV feature.  The cost was a bit more, but an excellent feature for doing so.  The setup was relatively easy, the quality quite good.  As a second TV it does not get much use, but a month later I am still delighted.  I usually buy Sony products, but am very pleased with this Samsung unit.  Sony had no comparable model.
