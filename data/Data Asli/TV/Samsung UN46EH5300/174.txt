I have been buying most of my movies and tv shows through iTunes over the years, and one of the first things a potential SmartTV owner needs to consider is that you can not access anything from Apple's ecosystem on these devices.  They run the Google Android OS (Complete crap on every device) which means no itunes access, so you either need to start your media library over again or just get a normal LED TV (for WAY less i must add) and just connect a $90 Apple TV to it.  I returned this and bought a 40&#34; Samsung LED HDTV for less, and even with the purchase of the AppleV i still saved money.Other considerations for SmartTVs  Yes they offer apps like Hulu and Netflix, but each manufacturer customizes the OS to their preferences so these App companies have an infinite number of platforms to support (Too many different flavors of Android, it is impossible to keep updates steadily streaming into the multitude of app stores).  Do not expect to get all of the bugs resolved, or even to get meaningful support, for any apps that run on a SmartTV.  They also run very slowly, and the controls are clunky.If you are an Android person you  amight be okay' with this purchase, but i have not found a single person who has been excited or even happy for the long term, for their SmartTV purchase.  Always running into problems and just reducing the scope of what they try to use, to the point of it being used like a regular TV.  What a waste of $$$.
