I am not a big techie so I needed something easy but wanted a SMART TV for the kids although heard sometimes it is more trouble than its worth- but this SMART TV really is smart and the kids know how to use it better than I do!  This TV was the perfect choice! It pretty much self does everything and I had no issues hooking it up at all! I loved it so much that I have the 47&#34; Slim version as well - both work fantastically well - picture, sound quality all excellent - really have no complaints at all...
