Purchased this product August, 2012.  The picture starting randomly going thru a light/dark phase.  Will go to snow white and then fade to black.  This has been going on for two days.  Today, a new wrinkle appeared.  A solid gray line appeared on the right side of the screen running from top to bottom and about four inches wide.  Should have gone with my first instinct and purchased a Panasonic which I will know do.  This is the second Samsung TV to fail within a year of purchase.  This was purchased for my mother to replace an ancient Sony that finally gave up the ghost after about ten years.
