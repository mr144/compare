Samsung customer service , well the nicest thing I can say is that it is a challenge. Two seperate days of calls and aprox 8 transfers after waiting long periods of time and my issue is not resolved. I wanted to put $10.00 on the apps credit. (Yes my credit card was fine , after being rejected twice on the website I checked with my credit card company.)  Still my card was not accepted so I tried a different credit card unfortunately with the same result.  I still do not have the app I wanted of the stars but at this point I feel I can live without it.My Amazon app for my video's is not working well. Netflix etc all work after a few seconds.The Amazon app can hang there forever (I waited once for over ten minutes before shutting the tv off). I finially decided to use my xbox to watch the Amazon vids and tv shows. Not really what I had bought a smart tv for but after the fiasco with trying to purchase some app credit I do not feel up to calling Samsung again, and as I said the others that are offered work fine.The tv is clear, great picture and decent sound.I am not sure I would purchase this tv again not because of the quality of the tv but because the app market is small, most of them are so-so also the problem with the customer service.
