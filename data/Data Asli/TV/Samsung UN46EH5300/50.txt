Set-up was easy. Picture is great. Do not much care for the &#34;smart screen&#34; with all the pre-configured icons, but I imagine I could change that if I really want to. Since I never use any of the apps other than Netflix, it is not a screen I access often. Wi-fi is really nice...no more Roku box. Sound is good. Menus are easy to understand and settings are easy to adjust. I think it is a great value for the price.
