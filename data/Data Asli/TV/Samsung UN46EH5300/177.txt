I just got finished installing this one on the wall in my kitchen breakfast nook area.  It's got all of the features I like from my other Samsungs (40&#34; LED SmartHub & 19&#34; LED).  I can now watch my Netflix, while eating my Cheerios/FruitLoops, soup & sandwich or my charbroiled steak & potato.  The 'SmartHub' is the greatest thing; since, sliced bread and/or peanutbutter.  Installation is a snap and tuning set-up is automatic; could not be easier.
