I love this TV all the features work and it was easy to set up with WIFI.  Beautiful picture and much more sound projected than I expected.  Hardly ever use my external sound bar I have attached to it. The ONE thing I hate is the crappy remote.  I have a Samsung tv a few years older and I wish the remote was like it. Where the hell is the favorite channel remote button?  Not to mention for web browsing... you have got to be kidding me!  I need to know of a wireless keyboard that is compatible with this set.  If you know of one, please let me know!Wifi signal is strong too,  My tv is in my bedroom down stairs but my router is upstairs.  For those having issues, maybe they need to change their wifi broadcast channel for  a stronger transmittance. Youtube does not play all the videos but it does play some I select  Glad they added Amazon prime for download, because I love my Amazon streaming and I am a prime member.Overall, I love the TV but hate the remote control! Yes, I would buy this HDTV again!!!! This TV is better than UN40ES6100.
