This product is no less than awesome.  I have no complaints and am very impressed with the color and true black.  The only issue would be the screen reflecting room light; if you let the sun in it will reflect pretty badly.  You can only notice when the screen is dark so it is not that bad for some, but me I prefer the non reflective screens.The wifi rocks and I can easily use the built in apps as well as load my personal ones.Awesome LED for the price!!!
