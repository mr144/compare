Samsung's 32 inch smart HDTV hits the mark for the money. It delivers exactly as promised: beautiful resolution, efficient smart TV features, and a well designed user interface.I have had this TV for 2 months (and likewise own a 46 inch Samsung smart TV for 3 years). The smart TV features on the 32 inch TV process faster than my 46 inch smart TV (which is 3 years older).The audio quality is very marginal, but such is the case with most televisions (most users  and certainly audiophiles will want external speakers).The user interface is mostly very good, aside from a clunky web browser with the smart TV features (I do not plan to do much web browsing from my TV).The wifi is seamless, works great and was simple to setup.Overall, very happy with this product.
