I am not a tech newbie. I know my technology and whole reason why I bought this was because of the Smart features. I has the Vizio E series before this. When this TV arrived I still had the vizio one, which was LCD. Somehow Vizio LCD was better then this LED TV. Anyways, I kept this TV as i love the Samsung smart tv features.Pros:All share is fantastic feature. Also if you have Samsung phone/tablet you can control the whole TV with an appPicture quality is actually very good if you set it up correctlySamsung Smart Hub and exclusive appsCons:Sound is very low. The second set I got has some sound issue, it resonate on high volume and it is very annoying.Whole smart TV features takes like 30 seconds to a minute to open up.Netflix takes like 30 seconds to connect.Thanks to Amazon, I could get a refund on this TV as I cannot live without the good sound.
