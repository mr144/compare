I needed to upgrade my 26&#34; TV for HD and to get two HDMI ports.  This slightly larger screen fit into my credenza with room to spare.  This TV offers a  nice combination of features at a reasonable price and should adapt to changing video offers for the next few years (I had my Sony for LCD for eight years).  I am not one to constantly get the latest as long as something works well and serves my needs.  But a lot has changed in 8 years, and I need to get more connectivity.  I have been using the TV for two weeks and have no issues.
