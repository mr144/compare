I bought this TV very skeptical of the smart features.  Since installing it I have not connected a cable to it so I could test the smart features.  Overall the smart features are very smooth and work pretty well.  It takes longer than I expected to start the Smart menu, but once in it the menus and text entries are very responsive.  I have been very happy with many of them.  WIFI is seamless.  Sound is OK, not great but good.  It is better than I expected it to be but I use it in a kitchen where sound quality is not quite as critical as it would be in a living room.  Remote is laid out well and works nice.  If you watch the Samsung marketing info about smart TVs, ignore the social media stuff with interactive camera and motion sensing actions.  This TV does not have that (you have to go up in size and model to get it).  I knew that before buying, but when shopping some places never distinguished between smart features on the Samsung models.Cons:  Youtube app does not work with the keyboard I put on the TV.  Not horrible, but not as convenient either.  Web app does not stream many video files (not flash compatible).  This is very disappointing.  Many popular sites with video do not work.  Cannot uninstall some apps that I do not use or plan to use.  The TV itself is very thick for an LED TV.  It seems obvious that Samsung used an older shell to put this TV in.  It does not matter where I installed it, but newer models are much thinner.Overall this is a pretty nice TV.  It is not perfect, but the smart functions work pretty well and are pretty convenient for the most part.  I would buy this TV again and would recommend it also.  Picture quality is very good.  I have not played with the phone app to control this much yet.  If the smart features had the web video streaming for different formats I would have gave this 5 stars.
