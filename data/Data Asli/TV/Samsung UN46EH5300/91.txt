The TV itself is great. Great picture, great sound, great value. However. The &#34;Smart Hub&#34;, which was a significant selling point of the device for me (hey, you mean I do not have to buy a peripheral device to stream media content? Awesome!), has a huge drawback. The apps on your TV require communicating with Samsung's servers. If the servers are down or undergoing maintenance, guess what? You do not get to watch Netflix, or Hulu Plus, or anything you have an app for.I set up my TV on Sunday and had no problems, although the constant software updating every time I turned on the TV was a bit annoying. On Monday night, I fell asleep with Netflix on and woke up to shut it off. I ended up not being able to go back to sleep right away, so I decided to watch something else. This time Smart Hub took a significantly longer time to load, and I could not open any of the apps at all. Instead I got a message reading &#34;ERROR_MODEL_BIND&#34; and was told to check my network settings. Which were fine. Every other device in my house was picking up the wifi signal, no sweat. I checked it a couple more times. Same message. I shut it off in defeat. This morning it worked fine again.After Googling the error message, this seems to be a frequently occurring problem for a lot of Smart TV owners. I wish I did bothered to look it up before I bought the TV or I would not have bothered getting this model.
