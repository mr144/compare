The TV is great and everything works well. The only issues with really bother me are1. On starting up the TV takes a good 3 mins to connect to the wifi network2. Navigating the browser, entering URL addresses and closing windows is extremely painful process - no way to prevent pop-ups too - Samsung has much to do to improve the browser3. Everytime I switch off when watching an online program the TV resets to the normal TV mode instead of opening the window that I left off at. Can imagine why.
