The new models are coming out in the next month or so, that made this tv a great bargain for the bedroom!  We are using it in the living room now, cuz the main room tv died on us a few weeks ago.  This is a 40 inch, smart tv.  The key here is 120 hz.  Make sure you get minimum 120 hz to avoid the motion blur.  The picture quality is fantastic to excellent.  The sound quality is not that good, but it was my understanding that that is the standard for these flat panel tvs.  I have got it hooked up to my receiver for the home theater blu ray experience anyways.  My first smart tv, we are still exploring this new area of tv land.  Internet on the tv, streaming video works great!  I was afraid that there would be problems here, as my broadband dsl service is pretty slow, but the streaming video has worked great, no delays.  The only delays we have seen is youtube.  That's stop and go to the point of being unwatchable with some videos--the lower quality videos are fine, the higher quality videos are stop and go unwatchable.Just two cons:  1, At first, the tv would periodically dim and get really dark.  I read the troubleshooting, and found this was the Eco Sensor, the tv automatically adjusts to the lighting in the room.  It did not seem to work too well, and got annoying.  I turned off the feature and now the picture is perfect 24/7.  2.  The other thing I would mention--it is too small for the main tv.  It will be moving to the bedroom when we purchase a larger version 2013 model for the main room.Great tv for the price!
