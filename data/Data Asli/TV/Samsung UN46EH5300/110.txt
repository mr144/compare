First,Amazon's price was great ($150-$225 less than anywhere else I did seen this model (5300 Series Samsung).  It also did not hurt that there was no tax and no shipping charge.  That saved me another $70-$80!!!Secondly,the TV is the newest Samsung 'SMART' TV.  It was easy to put together (just follow the manual).  The TV measured 36.5' width, but what I did not know until I opened the manual is ... arecommend you have 4' of space on all sides'.  As luck would have it the cabinet I have has about 5' left and right.  So make sure YOUR CABINET ALLOWS FOR THE EXTRA SPACE OTHERWISE (according to the manual) THE TV IS SUBJECT TO OVERHEAT AND BE DAMAGED.Everything else is perfect...the when my cable guys (BrightHouse) came to connect the TV to the cable, they showed me how to operate the features of my new TV.  They put in registration data for my Wi- Fi, and showed my how to pull up all my Apps (Netflix, etc.), and other features the TV had.And most importantly...when to use the remote for the cable and the remote for the TV.Picture and sound are fantastic. This TV is better than UN40ES6100. I could not be happier!!!
