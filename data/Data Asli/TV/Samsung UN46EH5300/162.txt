We purchased this TV as a replacement for a slightly larger Samsung HDTV that had stopped working. After a month everything is working great and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to hook up to the cable TV box as well as the Wi-Fi Internet connection. I thought it would take hours of playing around to get the setting right and it did not take much time at all.It has a great picture and the SmartTV functions and content are fun to explore.
