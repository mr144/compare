I have long been a fan of Samsung, with big exception of an early DLP Console TV which I spent thousands for and which failed miserably due to an engineering problem jointly created by Samsung and the DLP chip maker (Texas Instruments) in a conflict over proper cooling requirements.  I ended up sending a huge &#34;Darth Vader&#34; DLP TV to the junkyard via Best Buy when it was clear that the needed replacement chip was not going to be manufactured or provided by anyone.  IMHO our government regulators should have taken on both Samsung and the now defunct chip maker.This set represents the fifth purchase of Samsung TFT/LED technology I have made in the past few years.  I purposefully did not purchase the most sophisticated (3D) capable unit for my bedroom, but up-sized from 32&#34; to 40&#34; when a small CRT based TV finally failed in our guest bedroom.  The 32&#34; unit which is the oldest Samsung TV I own has now migrated to the guest room, and the new 40&#34; &#34;Smart&#34; TV has replaced it.When I finally had professionals pull Ethernet where I wanted it and built a little &#34;router shelf&#34; for my cable modem, router, and patch panel, etc., I pulled Ethernet to my bedroom, so when the new set came out of the box, I plugged in the Ethernet and it immediately began installing &#34;Patches&#34; from Samsung to its' built-in out of the box software that was shipped from Mexico a few weeks ago.  I am still exploring the available apps and options the &#34;Smart TV&#34; provides.  I am able to see photos and listen to MP3 tracks stored on a NAS hard drive connected via USB to my router.  The Samsung provided UI for the NAS file system sucks, but it works, slowly...in part due to the USB connection between the NAS drive and my router.  I am still not quite sure whether the TV is tracking my network via Ethernet and logging in wirelessly to my wireless network, but with 24 mbps download speed from my cable provider, the internet video and sound features I have tried so far all work without the annoying waits typical of slower internet hookups, regardless of whether the path to the TV from the internet is via my 1000 mbps Ethernet or the 56 mbps wireless network in my house.I immediately set up some of the Apps, like TED for example, and my Pandora One account.  The built in speakers, as expected, are not what I am prepared to live with long term.  I am still debating spending under $200 for a widely available Samsung 5.1 surround sound unit with DVD which would seriously clutter up the dresser tops or require me to mount several speakers on walls, or getting one of those Zvox pedestal analog sound systems which would sit under the TV and connect to the TosLink output from the on board sound chipset and allow me to use my cable provider's remote for everything except the &#34;smart TV&#34; features.I also immediately set the picture controls for the usually darkened viewing room where the TV sits.  Both my wife and I are beginning to have issues with cataracts, so the larger screen and more intense color settings help.  I am still not sure about the so-called 120 scan speed of this set which acts more like an interpolated 60 cycle scan than a true 120, which for me would be more than adequate.  The phosphors need a week or two to &#34;burn in&#34; before I can really tweak the picture, but so far it is satisfactory.  I plan to update this a little when some time has passed.
