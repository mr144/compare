Overall experience has been great.  I chose this set because of the Samsung reputation and it was the right size for my bedroom.  I do not yet have an HD receiver so the picture is not as good as it could be but it still is a very good picture.  Easily connected to my wireless and has worked perfectly for the past month.  I would highly recommend this set to others.
