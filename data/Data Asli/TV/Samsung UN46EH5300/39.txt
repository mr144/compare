1.) Poor packaging 2.) Poor Service TV would not turn on (looked like the outside package had been opened)..  The local Service Center has quoted more than 1 week to send a service person to look at the TV.  That's too long for a Southern New England service call. They also did not say how long a replacement might take.  I love my previous Samsung TV's. This one is not starting out so well. It would not be a huge problem, if I had not recommended this TV, based on my previous experience with the brand and the specifications,  to my mother  This hassle leaves me looking like a fool, for suggesting she buy this one.
