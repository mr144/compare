What can I say that has not been said before. This TV is a great HDTV for the price. The stand is easy to attach to the TV. Set up is really quick and simple including updating the firmware. All together I had it up and running in less then 3 minutes. The only complaints I really have with this TV is that the menus seem to lag a small bit and that there is it seems to have a combined RCA/Component hook up. I would have liked to have both hookups seperately. Those are the only complaints I can level at this TV though.So if you want a good HDTV at a good price then I did recommend it. My one piece of advice is if you have say some older videogame consoles like a Gamecube, PS2, etc you may want to get a switcher so that you can hook up multiple RCA and component hookups. .
