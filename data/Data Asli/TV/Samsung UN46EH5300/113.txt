Everything was working great until about 4 hours after the first plug-in, then the screen went blank and all we get is the flicker of the red light. 'Re-boot' does nothing, can not get any picture, menu, NOTHING. Took longer to get room ready and set up the TV than the time we got to use it. Now we will have to take it back, maybe even ship it to the manufacturer; the onus will be on us. Be careful with review ratings - the average might be really high but always check out the outlying low rankings to see what happened. Sometimes, it is just a customer venting when the product did not meet their expectations. In this case, the low rankings were folks with the same issue - the television simply stops working for no rhyme or reason. Loved our first Samsung 3 years ago but this experience means that I'll be looking for another brand. When I think about all the science behind the electronic components in this product and all of the calculations that are performed for product reliability and failure rates, I have placed all electronics companies on a ZERO TOLERANCE policy; one screw-up and you are DONE.
