Just the right size to be unobtrusive in our bedroom. Superb picture, although sound is just so-so. Adjustments with the audio settings help with this somewhat. We have been watching a lot of Netflix lately, and this set has Netflix built-in, along with a number of other apps. The wi-fi reception is excellent. My router is located on another floor, yet Netflix HD plays flawlessly. It also comes with Plex installed, so I can access all my own video and audio files easily from my PC downstairs. I do not have a cable box in the bedroom, so we basically use this TV to play Netflix and files from our own movie library. I highly recommend it for that type of use. One small gripe: it takes the Smart TV section (where the apps are stored) maybe ten seconds to load, no big deal really.
