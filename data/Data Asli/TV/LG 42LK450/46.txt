This TV placed tops in a recent Consumer Reports review of HDTVs in the size that I wanted (32'), so I decided to purchase it.It's a nice, no-frills TV.  Set-up was easy.  The picture offers numerous presets and lots of adjustments.The sound is the only thing I am not content with.  The problem is not the sound quality, it is the volume.  Between 20-80, there seems to be very little difference in volume.  Moreover, when I play Rocksmith (the guitar game which you play a real guitar with) through my XBox 360, there is a considerable delay between the time I play the guitar and the time I hear the sound of the guitar through the TV's speakers.  As a result, the game is not even playable.To counteract the sound problem, I hooked up external speakers, and there is no longer a problem.  Still, it would have been nice to not NEED to use a separate sound system.
