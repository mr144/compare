I have had this TV for about 8 months, and I certainly have mixed feelings about it.The good:at 42', it is plenty big for my apartment. With a bit of tweaking, the picture quality is decent.The bad:Out of the box, the picture quality is terrible. Take the time to calibrate it!It's a 60 Hz TV, and the difference between this and a 120 Hz is quite noticeable.The backlighting is inconsistent around the edges.The black levels are nothing to write home about.The sound is appalling. Seriously, if you are planning to use this without external speakers, think again.If you are using analog audio from your cable box, the display lag is noticeable. This could be the cable box's fault, though.Basically, I wish I did spent a few bucks more and gotten something nicer, but I am not kicking myself for buying it, because I got a good price.
