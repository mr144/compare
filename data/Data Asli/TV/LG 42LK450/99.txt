Our last two TV purchases were Samsung which we are also very happy with. After comparing prices found the LG to be less expensive with equally high rating (thank you Amazon raters)and made the purchase. Out of the box it was a hit I found the picture to be sharper with richer color, my wife found them pretty much equal. Very happy and would recommend. Four stars just because of not knowing the long term reliability.
