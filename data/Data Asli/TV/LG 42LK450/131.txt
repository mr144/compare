This 32' TV is good and close to being pretty good. I thought that the TV was not able to get bright enough for that pop in contrast that I like to see. I calibrate all my TVs based on using various calibration Blu-Rays as well as utilizing AVS forum user suggestions. While this may not be as good as a professional calibration, it usually works out well. I had this TV stacked up against the TCL 32', Sony 32EX310 and Samsung 32' 360 series. In the end, the TCL 32' seemed to provide an acceptable picture just not as detailed as the others, but it was able to provide better contrast than the LG & Sony (I was surprised as well). The LG when dialed in had the edge in PQ but I felt that it was still too soft. In the end, I stuck with my Samsung as I felt the picture was not as soft as the Sony and LG and provided enough contrast and sharpness to edge the others out. If you can get this TV for under $300, then it may be worth it, but with several other 720p's for $250 and under available, you may want to look at those first.
