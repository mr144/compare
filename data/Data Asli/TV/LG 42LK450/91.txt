Tv picture quality is astounding, 42 inch is enough to appear like you are in the theater & occasionally,in the picture itself. Easy set-up, though it does take a few hrs, so allow time, and delivery is so much better than trying to chug it home yourself & bouncing it up the stairs (or in the elevator.)I luv it, literally, wonderful for anything u want to see & super for movies. Was fun for the super bowl, but even better for seeing a movie. I had a 37' before, but this is so much better!!!!!!!!
