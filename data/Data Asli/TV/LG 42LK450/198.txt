I bought this as a Christmas present and it is been set up since Christmas eve.  So far there are no negatives to report. Set up was quick and easy. The HD quality is very good even without an HDMI cable connected. I feel I got a really good deal. LG products have been getting good revues for the most part and are giving the competion a run for the money.  It replaced a tv we had for almost 15 years so ask me to review it again in 2026.
