Very pleased with my LG 37' 1080p purchase.  After reading the amazon reviews I successfully adjusted the TV to my liking. It is an amazing picture!  Excellent value for the money and the 37' is the perfect size for my apartment. It does not overwhelm the room. I compared the LG to Samsung side by side at Best Buy. The differences were imperceptible. I purchased the LG because of better pricing on Amazon. I wouuld purchase a LG TV again.New York, NY
