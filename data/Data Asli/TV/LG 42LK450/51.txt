Nice picture but not great. No difference in clarity or sharpness moving from regular to HiDef. Went back and forth with Verizon and LG service. They both say its the other guy.  Changed cables checked signal strength both at optimum. Beach Camera documentation says they will not take TV returns but after taking to an agent he said since its only 32' they'll take it back. LG service reps a big disappointment. Not good communicators, not impressed with their knowledge. They were quick to put the blame elsewhere. Not really interested in solving my problem. Bought this model on a Consumer Reports rating. I will not go for an LG product in the near future.
