I ended up choosing this 32' LG TV because Amazon had a sale offering it for $299.  This model received the top rating from Consumer Reports and I avoided Black Friday mayhem by getting it from Amazon with free shipping.  The set was easy to set up with our cable box and has performed well for a month now.  I kind of wish I did gone slightly bigger (37'?) but the price difference between $299 and the larger screens was too much to justify (to me).  This LG model is a huge step up from the old CRT TV we had previously.  I am a happy camper.  The four stars is a reflection on my general belief that hardly anything is perfect.
