I LOVE this TV!!!! it has a wonderful picture, that is sharp and clear. It is also very easy to navigate inputs which is good because I switch between the TV, my xbox, and my old playstation 2 all the time! I have had this TV for about a year now and it is still going strong! I have not had a single problem with it and am so happy I went with this TV. I did a LOT of searching online and in multiple stores and this seemed like the best deal at the time and I have not had a single regret!!!the ONLY thing I have to say negative about it is that it has an auto energy saving mode, and when the light in the room changes the screen noticeably dims or brightens. It can be a little annoying at times, and I do not know that there is a way to turn this setting off. But that really is not a huge deal and is literally my only negative thing about this TV.
