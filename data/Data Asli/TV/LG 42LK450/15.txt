First of all, let me say that I am not the type of person to write reviews.  However, upon looking for a bedroom television, I realized how helpful they are and decided to write one for our living room TV.This television was one of the best investments I could have made.  It's made it through three moves and is still going strong.Pros:-Multiple HDMI outlets allowing for optimal gaming and video streaming (we have our XBox, Wii, and cable box connected).-The sound is great!  I am sure it would be better if you hooked up a home theater system, but we found no need for that.  The only complaint about sound is that the volume level changes when using different inputs (even though we have not changed the volume).  That's an easy fix though.-60Hz is perfect for us (We returned the 120Hz version because things looked too fake and it saved money).  60 Hz works great with gaming and watching football or other sports.-Different viewing modes and sound settings allow for a quick change depending on what you are watching/playing.-Easy to use and navigate remote and menu system allowed me to have my television up and running in no time!-Note: You may want to follow instructions and have an extra hand when putting it on the stand if you do not mount it.  There are numerous screws and you have to hold it all in place.  It's just easier with an extra hand.  Plus, with a wide television, it is easier to set it on your stand as well.  It's not heavy, but it is better to be safe than sorry.-Cons: None so farAbout our TV users:  Constantly streaming from Netflix and Hulu via Xbox and Wii; avid gamers; avid football fans
