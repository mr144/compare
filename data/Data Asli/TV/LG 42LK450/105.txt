First, I have never ordered a TV on-line.  Always been hesitant to do so.  But my experience with this TV and Amazon has definitely changed my mind.  The set arrived about three days earlier than the soonest-anticipated date and in excellent shape.  Thanks, Amazon.  I will do this again.Second, this TV replaced an 11-year-old Panasonic Quasar which was still going strong in my family room/office.  However, it was time for a change and I am extremely happy that I did.  This TV is excellent for what it is - a 37' lower-end set.  Color is great and currently is just hooked up to my cable line without a box and therefore without an HDMI cable.  I was going to get both but with what I am seeing at this point, may decide not to do that.  Sound is good although I may add a sound system, but again, really not necessary for where the TV is.This set makes my third LG TV and I would not hesitate to recommend this brand. The price was right, the service by Amazon exceptional, and the TV itself is great.  What more can you ask for?
