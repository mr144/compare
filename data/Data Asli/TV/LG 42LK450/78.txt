I am very satisfied with the LG 42LK450 television set purchased one month ago through Amazon. It has an excellent picture in every respect. It was delivered well within the estimated time and was very easy to connect and set up. However, the owner's manual and CD are terrible. They have attempted to cover too many models of sets in one instructional package. No less than 55 models are listed as being covered. Granted, there are substantial similarities in groupings of models, but there are also differences that are not obvious. We have struggled over gaining access to digital subchannels and only last night were successful. Still have not been able to set the clock to our time zone. Still the TV rates 5 stars and the instructions 1 star.
