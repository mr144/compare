Very disappointing when, after 1 1/2 weeks of use, the television started turning itself off and on while we were watching. It would not respond to the remote. It would not recognize a connected device. The only way to turn it off was to physically unplug it from the outlet. This was a used television from Warehouse Deals, not a new television. Picture quality was very good. Physical appearance was very good - too bad it did not work!
