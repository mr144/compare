I took a plunge and bought this 'like new' item because I could not justify spending full price just to upgrade to a bigger TV.  My smaller LG, and my smaller Samsung, seem to have crisper pictures.  The remote interface and options are well thought out (too bad we are all forced to use the cable company's cruddy remote as the 'first responder.')  My smaller TVs have better audio than this one, and so I have to have this volume higher or I can not discern some of the speech, but I am still learning, so this might be fixable.  This is more of a basic TV, but the price was right, and if I had HD service the video would probably wow me.
