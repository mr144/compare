I have had this TV for a few months now, so I figured I would write a quick summary of my experience with it.  Before I got this TV, it had been almost 10 years since I had owned a TV.  Since I did not need cable and have a tendency to move somewhat frequently, I had gotten used to just watching everything on my laptop.  While I still do not need cable (I use Netflix and Hulu Plus via my Apple TV), I did kind of want a bigger screen.  As I stated, I have not owned a TV in a while, so I can not speak about specs or anything.  What I can say is that, for what I use it for (which is to watch TV shows and movies), it works extremely well. The picture and colours are great.  It has multiple HDMI connections, so I have both my Apple TV and Roku plugged in and do not have to fuss with them whenever I want to utilise either.  I can not speak about the sound, as I have it hooked up to speakers.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.  It was a great price for a quality product.
