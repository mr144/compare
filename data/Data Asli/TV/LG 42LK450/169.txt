I have never been disappointed with an LG product. TV has beautiful display, plenty of ports for all our equipment. It recalls which ports you use most when switching between them (blue-ray player, cable, wii, etc.).The 32LK450 is an excellent value for the quality you get.Only complaint is that it has a weak digital tuner. My older digital TV could get better reception for the local news channels using the same indoor antennae. I had to buy an outdoor antennae to get it to work.
