Not a satisfied customer at this point in time!Purchased a tv; and the image was so poor that i feel completely ripped off; extremely dissapointed and very upset. i cant even tell what is on tv when looking at it because the image is so blurry and messed up; and looks like theres tiny ants running all over the screen! looked so awful no one had ever seen such a bad image before!I immediately contacted and drove this large tv (huge problem for my busy schedule) took it to a well respected professional about a half an hour away after having to trouble shoot a babysitter for my very dissapointed waiting kids; he confirmed after hooking it up and simply viewing its image; that it was definately not right, im not a happy camper and actually believe that i deserve a call at my residence to explain whatin the world went so wrong?My family was extremely dissapointed; theres definately some explaining to do on this one... would love to continueto feel confident about purchasing electronics online; but this one was a huge huge huge letdown so far; like i said; Im not surethat i would ever purchase electronics from online ever again because of this one bad experience; because after all; i had much higher expectations!Beware television purchases online people this one was a total flop!! Just purchasing from the regular stores are much less of a headache and stress and totally worththe people there that can make sure that your getting an honest good working tv that is not a rip off.just a note thanks for reading!!
