We bought this tv for the toy room.  Our cable company did away with the analog signal so we upgraded so we could receive the DTV signals without connecting to a box.  I paid the extra $4 for next day delivery and it arrived in less than 24 hours after I ordered it.  Super easy to set up and the picture is fantastic - especially for not being hooked up to a cable box!  I did not know regular tv could look this good!  And it is straight out of the box, I did not even mess with the setting yet.  We also played Wii and hooked up Netflix and no problems at all.
