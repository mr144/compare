My tv was clearly USED, the packaging was horrible. Everything on the inside was messy and the protective white foam had chunks missing out of it all over. I paid for a new tv and what I got was crap. Customer service still havent gotten back to me. I will never order Electronics from amazon again. Not to mention there is a weird line that goes across the screen when its on, it messes up the picture. It goes away sometimes then comes back.
