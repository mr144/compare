My old TV was 15 yrs old and quite different from this one. I am still adjusting the settings to find what I like.It is a very nice looking TV and a good size for my living room. I have it on a stand that moves around so I can watch it from anywhere in the room. The only thing I am not too pleased with is the stand. It is just made of molded plastic. With the admonition not to over tighten the screws joining the stand with the back of the TV, I have tightened them as much as I dare but the TV is still sort of wobbly. I would like something a lot more rigid especially since I live in California and worry about earthquakes ( I can just picture the TV stand snapping off and crashing to the floor).Delivery of the item was very quick, the packaging very good-it was easy to unpack-and I was able to assemble it and set it up myself ( I am a 73 yr old woman).All-in-all it is a nice TV and I gave it only 4stars because of the wobbly stand connection.
