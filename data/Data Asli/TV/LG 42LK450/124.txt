I bought this TV because it got over 150 5-star ratings.  The picture on this set is awful.  It is fuzzy and unclear.  The sound is also terrible, has a static sound in the background.  I have played with all kinds of settings on both the picture and the sound but I am sending it back asap.  Hopefully this review will save someone from buying this 2-star rated TV!
