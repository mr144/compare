We wanted to purchase a new television for my mother with a large screen as she is 82 and finds it sometimes difficult to see everything on her old television.  We did have concerns that the images would appear 'stretched' as she did not purchase the high definition option from her dish company. We were very pleased with picture and the ease of setting up everything.  Mom said it is the best gift that she has every received.
