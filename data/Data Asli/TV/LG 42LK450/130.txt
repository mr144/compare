Just want to say how pleased I am with this TV. I spent a long time looking for the best deal on the 'Bang for your Buck' HDTV. I am set up with a nice 3d blu-ray player and an xbox with an old Sony surround sound system. I could use even my old surround system with the optic cable, and have two different HDMI inputs for my blu-ray and XBOX so that I have surround all the time and never have to unplug cables. The picture quality goes from decent to very good after 12 hours of viewing. I think the picture quality on Netflix and regular movies is alright, and the Blu-rays are fantastic (obviously worth the 1080p vs 720p those who are debating those two). The sound with the TV by itself is ok (I read that it is better than most) and the settings are easy to mess around with. If you are looking to use this TV for yourself you will be MORE than happy I guarantee it. If you need to impress friends or loved ones that are intense critics or you yourself are a master of the HDTV world as many I read on here are then you should probably spend the extra money on a 120 hz or a top of the line TV. Hope this helps, btw LG has had great support so far for me for those who question that part of a company you are investing in. If you do buy the TV immediately turn off the energy saver and run movies for half a day. You are welcome in advance ;)
