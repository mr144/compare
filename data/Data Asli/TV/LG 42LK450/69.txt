Bought this LG 42LK450 based on the recommendations (thank you, Amazon customers!) two weeks ago.  Since some very recent reviews complain about the picture, I wanted to give our experience so far.  The picture is outstanding, setup was easy -- even adding a Sony wi-fi Blu-ray for our first foray into that world -- with pre-existing DirecTV.  Sound is good to quite good.  I was apprehensive about the hookups since we are on a wireless rural tower that has its challenges.  Streaming (NetFlix, Amazon) has been good to excellent and fairly easy to set up as well.  I was reluctant to get rid of the old Toshiba CRT TV with excellent sound and picture, as it was produced back in the day when quality in TVs was reliable.  However, the captain is extremely pleased with this set and so is the admiral (60-somethings).  I was sure the 42-inch screen would be overwhelming since we only sit about 11 feet away, but it is great.  Even photos displayed from our modest point-and-shoot Canon are great. Beautiful screen with non-Blu-ray DVDs, streaming, and HD TV stations, but also very good with non-HD stations.  Excellent with Blu-ray.  Minor point, but the remote is the best ergonomic design I have seen.  We did buy locally since country living makes product returns, especially of this size, painful.  Now crossing fingers to hope the set quality is also durable.
