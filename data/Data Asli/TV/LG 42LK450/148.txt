Just got this TV on New Year's Eve. Took longer to purchase it than it did to set up. Four screws in the base and four screws into the TV and a power cord completed the set up. Afterwards I plugged up the cable and the TV was off and running. Picked this one up at Best Buy for 189 + tax so it was a steal. I have been playing PS3 games on it constantly and I cannot see where 120hz could improve the picture. TV's auto color function is a little strange to get used to if you are used to bright plasma's in dark rooms. The tv will not choose to be bright if the room is dark and for some people manual settings will be preferred.
