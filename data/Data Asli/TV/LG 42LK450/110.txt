The picture quality is absolutely gorgeous! I can not say enough about the sharpness and clarity of this TV. When I first turned on the TV the picture was too dark but that was remedied by adjusting the energy saving feature to off or low. Assembly was about 10 minutes and simple. The real problem I had was the remote! After hooking up the TV to my cable box (HDMI) I found I was unable to use the (TV) function of the remote and instead had to use one of the HDMI inputs which caused me to lose some of the functionality of the LG remote. Instead I decided to run the TV with my cable box remote. Except for the remote problem I would have given this review a 5. One thing I was not prepared for was how good my standard DVDs looked on this set. I also noticed that even the non-HI-DEF channels look great on this box. The sound is perfect and I can detect no problem with high motion video or sports. When I turned on the set for the first time I noticed that it was set to a high contrast and brightness neither of which is needed so I lowered both by half and the picture is still great. For those hard to satisfy viewers there are plenty of picture adjustments to keep them happy. I worried about getting a TV by UPS but it arrived in perfect condition and is packed very sturdily. I also worried whether a 32' would be too small but for me it was just right. All in all-a good buy.
