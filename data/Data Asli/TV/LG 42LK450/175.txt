In short, this is a great TV for the price, but I should have read more reviews before purchasing.  I have a Samsung 1080p LCD and a Panasonic Viera 1080p LCD in my home and those TVs are also entry level LCD's like this LG one, but the main difference is the viewing area.  The image quality is great, but this LG Model's image quality suffers almost immediately when you venture away from sitting directly in front of it.  The Samsung and Panasonic TV's I have are totally viewable from 45 degrees from center.Do not get me wrong, this is still a good TV for the price, but for me the viewing angle degradation is enough for me to return this model and to purchase a comparably priced Samsung (LN40D550) or Panasonic (TC-L42U30).READ, READ, READ reviews before you purchase your TV, and not just the Amazon reviews!
