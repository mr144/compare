I am typically a Samsung LED family but I wanted to buy my parents a new TV for Christmas that would fit on their stand so I lQQked for a 37'. Did not want a cheapo model as they deserve better but did not want to go for my lungs cause what you do for your parents you have to do for your in-laws. There were not many choices as I hear most TV companies are either cutting way back or getting rid of their 37' models. Such a shame since this size fits in and on many TV consoles nicely with out having to reduce down to a 32' and the 4' as in my case was to big.Any way I did my D&D on this LG and spoke to my brother-in-law who installs cable in homes who gave it a thumbs up.So I ordered it from Amazon at a better price then best buy or any other place I could find on Thursday and was delivered on Saturday just in time to wrap for Christams.Once you install the 8 screws in the stand it was just plug and play. I set this TV up in a matter of 15 minutes. What great picture quality and the volume was way better then I had thought.I have some very happy parents. I would recommend this TV to anyone. I do not see any flaws.
