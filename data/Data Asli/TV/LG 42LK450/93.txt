I deliberated over which TV to buy for weeks, trying to find the best deal when I stumbled upon this one. The size is good for the price and I have no complaints. There was some adjusting of the settings when I first received it but the picture is beautiful and the sound quality is great. It's a perfect TV for a bedroom.
