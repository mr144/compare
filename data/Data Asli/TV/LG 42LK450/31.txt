We have had the TV for a couple of months now and are very very pleased.  The feature that I value most other than the obvious (picture & sound) is the light sensor.  We use this TV in our bedroom so it is frequently on when the lights are off.  The fact that it dims itself accordingly so that there is not a bright light in our dark room is fantastic.  Then when you turn the lights on, wait a few seconds and get brightens accordingly.  Menus/remote are very easy to navigate.We are very satisfied with this unit.
