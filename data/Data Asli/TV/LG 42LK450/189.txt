I bought this tv for my 6 year olds room with the idea I may watch it on occasion. I bought this after reading all the great reviews but never saw it in person. Set up was extremely intuitive and I did not even open the manual. After the brief calibration process, the streamed netflix picture beats my 55' high def signal hands down. Colors, contrast, resolution etc.  are stunning......almost looks 3 dimensional! Now I want to watch this tv all the time. Unbelieveable bang for the buck. I will be buying another.
