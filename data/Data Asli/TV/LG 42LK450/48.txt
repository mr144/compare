This is the fifth wide format HD TV I have owned, compared to those of the past its a great unit, sometimes you may see a line at the top of the screen but that is usually the fault of the broadcaster, I like this unit because of the features and the productivity of the unit itself, the video board has multiple inputs and outputs, rendering seems to work out very nicely for regular HD, as well as Blu Ray...
