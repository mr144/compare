I purchased two of these LG 32LK450 32 -Inch 1080p 60Hz LCD VA Panel HDTV.  They were Christmas gifts for our children.  They both are performing with clarity and without problems.  The fact that you can hook up your computer directly to the TVs is what our children like best.  I would reccommend this product to anyone looking for a very good TV with a great picture.
