I never actually take the time to review anything... which should not be the case because I read lots of reviews and research before I make any important buys. Either way... I am really impressed with this TV and the price. I purchased it on Black Friday for $300!! What a steal!!! I want to buy the same TV in other sizes for other rooms in my home. Resolution is great and I like that it has touchscreen buttons in the front to turn on and off, volume, channel and input. TOTAL RECOMMENDATION!!
