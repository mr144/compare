I am not a TV aficionado or anything, but we love our TV. It's our second LG LCD television (bought a 32 inch in 2007) and both have given us no issues. This is only our 2nd LCD flat screen, so I can not compare to other brands, but when I did research (lots of research :-) LG seemed to have good value (i.e. good price and good quality).  Again, I can not compare other brands, but I feel like it has GREAT quality.  Movies, video games and HD tv shows keep us very entertained.  We have not gone to the movies in a while as a result :-)
