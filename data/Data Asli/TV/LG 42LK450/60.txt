April 2012 Had the tv for a total of two days and I like it so far. Had an old, outdated, heavy, color-faded set before. This one is good! To start, it is so light. I am a 25 year old woman and I was able to carry it inside from where the fedex guy left it by myself. Set up was quick. I did need to find a rather long and slender screw driver to get the tiny screws into the base. I love that it has 3 HDMI ports and two RCA inputs. Picture is alright- not quite as good as my ex's isymphony, but still lovely. It did not come with an HDMI cable. I was able to program my directv remote to work all of the controls on the television, satellite and dvd. Love the touch controls on the face of the television.I'll add to this as time goes to see how well the tv holds up to the rigors of a family who loves their entertainment.__________________________________________________________________________________________________UPDATEHad it for a little more than a month. Still liking it. Got it hooked up to the ps3, bluray is knock-your-socks off pretty. Sound's still leaving a bit to be desired. Gonna look into getting a speaker bar. It is a dust and finger print magnet, so keep your little cleaning cloth that comes with it nearby. I noticed that it does have a little sticky plastic wood grain thingy on the front of the tv that I had not noticed before. It's starting to peel off, which is why I noticed it. I think the tv would look nicer without it, but I am worried about pulling it off because I do not know if what's behind it is worse looking (why else would they put it there?). No trouble with image burn and have had LOTS of widescreen black bar action going on.__________________________________________________________________________________________________Jan 2013UPDATE 2- Almost a year since I bought it, still working perfectly! No dead pixels, no issues with speakers or sound. This tv gets a lot of use. It's on probably 15 hours every day. Love it! Worth every penny.
