I actually really liked this TV but husband thought it was poor picture...not sharp.  He bought a Samsung....guess what!  we returned that one, too.  The reason we have been married almost 44 years is COMPROMISE.  Neither one would be happy with each other's selection, so we returned both 32-inch TVs and purchased (together) a 42-inch Sony.  We love the new TV (and each other).
