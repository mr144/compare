Now, im no TV expert but I am pretty satisfied with my purchase. the only thing I would suggest is getting a sound system because I have had the tv for about a year and a half and the sound is pretty low and sometimes I have to turn it off and on again to get the sound to come through but the picture is clear and even works well with my iphone HDMI connector cord.
