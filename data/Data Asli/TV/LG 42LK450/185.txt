This tv is junk.  The brightness is awful and is caused by the energy saver feature.  On this set you can not not shut the energy safe feature off, thus the screen is extremely dark.  My wife and I could not deal with the darkness of the screen.The screen itself feels like a $5.00 junk toy.  It is made of cheap plastic and is very cloudy thus it makes the picture look cloudy.I attempted to watch last nights Monday night football but I believe because it is only 60Hz it can not refresh fast enough.I bought this hoping to get a good quality economical set for our bedroom.  After one day I took it back and will upgrade to a better set.
