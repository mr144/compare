I mainly use this TV for gaming. After switching the power saving mode off (it get's annoying when it auto dims the screen)it was practically perfect for the price. I just wish I could have a little more control in the settings menus.Pros:-Great Price-Great display-Good amount of input connections-Has VGA input-Swivel standCons:-Power-saving mode auto dims the display (can be switched off)-Settings menu gives little control
