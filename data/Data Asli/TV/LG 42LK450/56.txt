I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS SET FOR A LONG TIME. PRICE WAS STILL HIGH ( $ 400.00) IN STORES AND ON LINE. FINALLY I GOT IT AT A ' CLEARANCE PRICE' AT A LOCAL STORE IN MIAMI FOR MUCH BETTER PRICE. THIS TV IS ALREADY DISCONTINUED BY LG AND THE NEW SET LACKS SOME OF THE FEATURES THIS ONE HAS. THE PICTURE WITH HD SATELLITE IS GREAT.TV SOUND NOT THAT GREAT; TYPICAL OF FLAT PANEL TV'S. ANYWAY I HAVE A SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM CONNECTED WITH THE SATELLITE RECEIVER. NO BIG DEAL. I AM STILL  TRYING TO ADJUST THE PICTURE QUALITY TO MY LIKING. IF YOU SEE IT FOR LESS THAN $ 400.00 BUY IT WITHOUT HESITATION. YOU'LL BE GLAD.
