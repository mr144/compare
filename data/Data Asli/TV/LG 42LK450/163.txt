We did the research and from all we found out about the LG 32LK450 LCD, it was highly regarded. When the price came down significantly on Thanksgiving Day, we jumped on it and got a great deal. Since it is a Christmas gift, we all had to wait to see if it measured up to all the reviews. Our experience so far has been that it is OK but nothing to be impressed with. The color image was poor to begin with so we used the menu options to find the best picture quality which is great until you save the changes and then try to watch sometbing. There is a feature on this unit that automatically adjusts to the lighting in the room. The TV appears to be trying to make adjustments constantly which causes the color quality to be affected and the image gets washed out. We are still trying to find a way to turn this off in hopes the color image can improve. We may eventually find a solution but for now, I would not purchase another LG LCD TV knowing I would have to constantly be trying to get it to look acceptable.
