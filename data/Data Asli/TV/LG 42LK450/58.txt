I bought the LK520 model (32' 1080p) from another store and thought I did post a helpful review.Pros: Very good image quality. Good amount and variety of conections. Sturdy base with swivel. pretty lightweight and easily wallmountable. Great image tweaking feature.Cons: Contrast ratio could be a little higher but honestly I do not see much of a difference from my other tv choices. Too bad it is not a little bit thinner but its not that thick at all. (I love those super thin LED tvs....) No actual buttons on the TV itself, you must use a remote. (Sucks if you lose the remote and have to buy another) Stay about 3-4 ft away for the best image.
