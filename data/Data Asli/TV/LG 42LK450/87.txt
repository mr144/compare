The TV came with a large crack along the front edge.  I was not able to hit the return window because a) I needed to follow up with the large package department, which I am unable to bc of work hours/constraits vs. large package dept hours, b) the amazon 24 hour support refused to give a direct contact so I could email my complaint and c) If I cannot call during work hours, when am I going to have the time to return the item?  I ordered online bc of my constraints.  Amazon really let down a long time customer here.
