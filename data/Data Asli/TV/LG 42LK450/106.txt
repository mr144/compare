After solving several odd problems, my 32LK450 got a fabulous picture BUT ... the extremely narrow viewing angle and a problematic tuner compelled me to send it back. My LK450 absolutely refused to give acceptable TV performance until I replaced my RG59 coax with RG6. RG59 is supposed to be acceptable for cable TV but my LK450 did not work too well with it.  (My 42' Vizio worked fine on the same RG59 even further downstream.) When I played a DVD, I could see the picture quality the LK450 is capable of. The one feature of LG I really liked, after I got used to it, is the way the remote works. It is odd at first but after a short time I really liked it. Amazon scheduled a UPS pickup and refunded my money with no hassle at all. I purchased a 26' LV2500 which actually is a better size for my office. It has a brighter picture but just does not have that eye-catching pop the LK450 had. The LK450's sound, though not spectacular, was acceptable. The viewing angle and the TV tuner are my only two complaints about the LK450. The picture, as long as I was directly in front of it, is the best I have seen.  Yes, even over $ony and $amsung.
