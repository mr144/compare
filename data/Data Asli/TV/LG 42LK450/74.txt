I bought the 42 inch LG tv. I had previously owned a 32 inch Samsung, but unfortunately the TV ended up being given to someone else. I figured LG is a known brand, and $500 for a 42 inch 1080p was a good deal. It came in 2 days cause of my Amazon Prime shipping, and it was pretty easy to set up. The Blu-Ray looks fantastic. I was really surprised on how clear everything was. For HD tv, I have Time Warner Cable. The HD channels do not like as good, but they still are decent. I am assuming its the cable company and not the tv, since blu ray looks good. This tv is for my bedroom, and I do notice that you have to stand back a bit from it. Seems pretty obvious, the closer you are the more blurry it gets. When I am sitting in my room or laying on my bed, it looks crisp and detailed. No complaints about the tv this far.
