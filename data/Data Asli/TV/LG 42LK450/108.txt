The TV was offered by Amazon at the lowest price point about 4 weeks ago. The shipping was quick and uneventful except for damage to the flimsy LG packaging. The shipper had unboxed it and checked for damage to the contents. I was offered the option of refusing delivery for the mangled box. Setup was easy and also uneventful. If you are planning on using the digital tuner for over the air signals, it seems to be only mediocre. The picture is very good from an HD source. The sound thru the on board speakers is adequate. A full range of adjustments are possible, but I have stuck close to the defaults for the Cinema mode for both color and sound. The TV is good looking but I would have preferred a mat finish on the bezel. The brown trim strip on the bottom edge does not improve the look but those reviewers who are obsessing over it, probably need therapy. Overall, it is quite a good value and a satisfying purchase.
