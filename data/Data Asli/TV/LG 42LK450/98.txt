This TV was a Christmas gift for my out-of-state brother.  I chose this LG after going to my local stores to physically compare the pic & performance of various brands of TV's.  Reading many reviews online for this TV convinced me that I had made the right choice.  Amazon purchase was smooth and easy.  I tracked delivery on line and made the trip to my brother's on the day the LG arrived.  This product is everything that I anticipated when I read the reviews on it.  We are extremely pleased with the quality, clarity, color and performance.  We feel that we got a lot of TV for the price -- this was a great bargain!
