I bought this for my grandparents who had an old 32' tube tv for Easter. I ordered it kind of close but got the product right on time. I set it up for them, it was real easy & easy for them to figure out too. Image quality is great. Most of the reviews for this tv were good so I felt safe & it was a great buy. I have been a Sony guy for a long time but I'll say LG's are great too.
