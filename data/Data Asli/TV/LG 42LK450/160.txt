We needed a 2nd TV, our tastes differ and our other TV is in the living room and mainly watched by my wife watching dramas, news and QVC.  The primary TV is an LG 37' in an armorer, this 32' LG is on a desktop wing and has the same quality, good picture, decent sound.  I use it to watch football, road racing and financial news.  Although it is 60Hz blurring is not a problem, I would not pay extra for 120 or 240 HZ. It is a good general purpose TV that could be used in a bedroom, kitchen or child's room.  I could use it for a computer monitor but I have an older 22' LG monitor for that.  Amazon had it here in 4 days, hookup was simple, programing the cable remote was a two minute job, most 10 year old's could do it, your maiden aunt, at 75, may need some help.  I have 50+ years of computer experience to fall back on. I am completely satisfied with the set, would recommend it for my elderly neighbor but would show her/him how to install it.
