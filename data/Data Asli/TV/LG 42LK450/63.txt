I just want to stress that while there is a digital (TOSLINK) audio out, there is NO RCA AUDIO OUT. This means if you are using it like I was (Computer HDMI to the TV) and hoping to run the audio back to a receiver with no TOSLINK, you are out of luck. This was a deal breaker for me, so I returned it and got a larger LG TV with audio out.If you read some of the many reviews of this TV you'll find good information.  I do feel that it is a good product for the money. Good picture, might fall a little short for sports/gaming.
