Purchased from Amazon on 26 Dec 2011 and it arrived via Fedex on 29 Dec. No damage in shipment. Took 30 to 45 minutes to remove from packaging and set it up. Picture and sound quality are comparable to my 52' Sony Bravia KDL-52W3000 which is to say it is excellent. If you are considering the purchase of an entry level set this unit should be on your short list. If by chance you purchase a set that is damaged, incomplete or otherwise unserviceable,I would highly recommend an exchange as the failure rate on this set appears to be quite minimal.
