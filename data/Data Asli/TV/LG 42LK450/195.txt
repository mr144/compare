The first LG 32' TV we received did not work. There was some type of issue preventing us from getting through the start up sequence.  Amazon replaced it very quickly. The replacement TV is great! Very good picture and sound. The third HDMI connection is great, allowing for the cable, the DVD player and the Roku!
