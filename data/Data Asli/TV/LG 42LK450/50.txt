Had a little trouble attaching the stand to this as the screws included were too short. After a trip to the hardware store and purchasing some screws I was able to attach the TV to the stand. The TV works great so far, no dead pixels, and no trouble with the actual TV itself. It works well being hooked up to a Roku device and Playstation 3. The remote is nice as well.
