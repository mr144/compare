I love the LG 37' TV. It is the right size for my mobile home, the sound is terrific, and the overall look is impressive. I had previously purchased a 32' Vizion TV from Wal Mart and returned it because of the sound quality. I was relieved to find that I could find the size and brand I wanted at Amazon.com. I would highly recommend LG brand to anyone wanting a quality television.
