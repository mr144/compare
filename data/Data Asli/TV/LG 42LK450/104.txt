This is our second LG television. The first one - a plasma - has been a terrific television. It works great and has a beautiful picture. When we needed to replace an older heavy traditional type television, we definitely wanted another LG. We were limited to a smaller size and LG offered exactly what we needed. We had some concerns since this one is an LCD and not a plasma, but we did not need to worry.This new LG also has a beautiful picture. We are very happy with it. I highly recommend LG. Delivery from Amazon was very fast and free! It arrived in great shape.
