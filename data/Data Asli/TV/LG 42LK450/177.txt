This is our third TV, our other two are Samsungs and we are very satisfied with the Samsungs. We bought this TV as a TV for a bedroom, so our needs were not great, but we did want a nice 1080p TV.This TV is fantastic. The picture is outstanding and the sound is pretty great too. It's one of the few HDTVs we could find that had regular non-HDMI ports in the back to hook up a DVD player to the TV, which was a nice bonus.Long story short we love this TV and it is completely on par with our Samsungs.
