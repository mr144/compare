I recently tested this TV.  I probably would have kept it if it had arrived intact, but it had been significantly damaged in shipping, and I went with a Sony Bravia 40' on my second chance.  I was still able to watch the LG TV and assess its picture quality.  (I'll keep my comment about shipping short, but beware that Amazon's Warehouse packing of TVs can be scary-silly, with no foam between the outside of a flimsy cardboard box and the screen. So--Amazon: use more foam!).Now--the aesthetics of this TV.  I encourage anyone interested in this TV to read the review at televisioninfo-dot-com.  There's a very detailed account there.  To summarize the review in one sentence: this TV has excellent color, but it has weak blacks.  I read the review before  I got the LG, and I thought the review might be knit-picking, but my in-person impression: the criticisms (echoed by CNET) are correct.  This may be a matter of taste; but I think most people like cinematic, high contrast capabilities in their TVs.  I think many people could still could make peace with this TV: it has, like most LGs, excellent build quality (until Amazons' packers and shippers crashed it) and picture adjustment menus.  The Bravia cost slightly more but has a crisper, higher-contrast image.
