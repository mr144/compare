I agree that this is a first-rate set at a very reasonable price, but I also agree that the manual is hopelessly inadequate. There is virtually no explanation of the options that are available through the 'Home' and 'Menu' buttons, and it took a call to LG to get my set working properly. The person there was helpful and courteous.
