Not bad for a secondary TV.  Definitely better than I expected from an entry level priced TV.  Would recommend to others.Pros:-Decent color reproduction-Bright back light (cold cathode)-decent sound, not special but not bad either.-reasonable thickness (~3-4 inches)-Auto energy setting: this automatically adjusts the backlight based upon the ambient light in the room.  I love this feature.  We watch TV in bed with no lights on and the TV does not blind you.  In daylight it automatically ramps the backlight back up.Cons:-NOT LED backlit.  The tech specs on the amazon listing say its LED backlit... its not.  Its a standard cold cathode light.-Poor black levels and contrast (but about like pretty much every other LCD set I have seen).  The dynamic contrast settings seem to do a decent job at compensating for the LCD technology though.  Still pretty watchable.-Color reproduction on auto energy mode: One of the big reasons I bought this unit is the auto backlight sensor.  However, when you have it turned on, it auto changes the color, contrast, sharpness and other settings as well.  This negates any corrections you might have made using the color wizard.  If you choose the 'corrected' color profile, it no longer uses the automatic lighting sensor.
