I really like this TV. It is my first flat panel television, and I am glad I got this one. The picture is excellent for my xbox, and each video mode has its own settings. The only problem i really have is that the visual volume meter thing (when you change the volume this thing pops up) Is a blue and white circle in the bottom right corner, and i would have preferred just a bar somewhere. Other interface elements are well designed, understandable and easily modified. I used the setup guide included in the menu system in conjunction with a game disk to set my screen up so that all games are spectacular looking. Another feature i love is that i can stick a USB drive into the side and play video files, AND THIS TV READS THE MKV FORMAT!!! So thrilled about that! So far I have just used MKV and AVI. I have had this for a while now and nothing has caused me to freak or stress.
