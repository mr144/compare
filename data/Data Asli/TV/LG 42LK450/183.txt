The TV was delivered promptly.  Easy and quick to set up.  Volume can seem a little low for a TV of good quality, but I think its because many might expect to only having to go to 20 or 30 to reach a necessary volume level.  However I have experienced the necessity to turn it up to the 50-70 range to get the volume level you really want (I was surprised it even went this high!).But overall, for $299, there really was not much to complain about.  Good picture, decent sound, easy to use.  What more could you ask for!
