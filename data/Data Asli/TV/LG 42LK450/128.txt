I ordered this tv aware of the LG panel lottery but I doubted the 42 inch would be a VA. Most VA cases I have seen are 32 or 37 inch.  I received it and got unlucky with the 'D' panel which usually means VA instead of IPS. I  ran the loupe test and confirmed that it is 100% VA.Pros: Cheap, Nice picture, plenty of inputs, looks good with 360, decent input lag, nice basic features, the blacks are pretty good.Cons: Ugly brown bottom, chance of getting VA, very barebones, there's no way my VA version has 4ms response time.Overall, I would have rated this tv a five but just because LG runs the panel lottery ima give it -1.I have yet to run 4:4:4 chroma. I have heard mixed reviews to whether or not the VA panel can do so. Ill come back and edit it later.If your really picky about IPS i did stay away from buying this model on Amazon.
