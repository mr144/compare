We had this TV hooked up and running in no time. The only thing we had a slight problem with was assembling and attaching the stand (our household screwdriver was not long enough to reach all the way into the recessed area) but that only took an extra minute or two to remedy. We love the picture quality! Sound is better than our old set; happy with it, too. Remote is easy to use. The sleep timer can be set for up to 4 hrs! Captions are clear and easy to read (we use them when a show's dialog is hard to hear). Setup menu is simple and easy to understand. Definitely would recommend this set.
