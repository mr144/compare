I picked this up as part of the Black Friday surge around Thanksgiving 2011.  It has worked flawlessly since I unboxed it.  It's absurdly light, but does not have a cheap feel to it.  The body does not easily flex, there are no rattling noises when moving it around and the picture quality is outstanding.If I had to write up cons for this device, the only two things I could think of are extremely minor.  In fact the first one does not apply if you are not using the stand.1) The wells that you have to screw the base into require a *very* long screwdriver to properly tighten 2 of the 4 screws, but if you mount the tv on a wall or backstand unit, this is a non-issue.2) The speakers are a bit weak by themselves.  There is practically no bass output from them, so you will not 'feel the rumble' if you plan on just piping the sound into this set.  Using the audio out or running signal from a receiver in the first place will easily get around this.I am currently using this as my monitor for my desktop PC.  There are absolutely no issues with ghosting when gaming or watching netflix.
