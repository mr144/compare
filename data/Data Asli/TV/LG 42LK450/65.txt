Ordered this tv as a gift for my dad.  The box was dented on arrival but the tv looked fine.  When we hooked it up, however, the screen was damaged.  We ordered a replacement of this tv on the same day.  When the replacement arrived, this box also appeared dented and, sure enough the screen on the replacement tv was also broken.  Did not try a third time!!  Whether damaged in storage or damaged in shipping, it is not worth the gamble... Go buy the tv from a store!
