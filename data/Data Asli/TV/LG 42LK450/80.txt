Easy to asseble. Very good basic screen images and sound of TV speakers are decent enough.  If you like cinema sound-like when seeing movies you have the option of doing your own connections.  So far, I am very satisfied with this 42' TV purchase.  I would surely recommend it without any hesitation.
