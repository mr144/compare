LG TV arrived quickly and well packed.  It was very easy to install as a wall mount ( I had a suitable mount ) as it is very light for a fairly large screen, 18+ lbs..  Even though it is a secondary TV and not hooked to HD, the picture quality is very good.  A true bargain in a name brand at the price purchased.
