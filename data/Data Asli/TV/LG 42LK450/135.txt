I have just had the LG 42LK420 TV for a week now. It is what you get for the price, a lower end HDTV.I had previously owned a Samsung, and its picture quality was superior to this TV.The HD picture quality is reasonably good, though not as good as my previous TV. The picture quality for the SD channels is not at all up to the mark.Also, the TV does not have an inbuilt antenna to catch over the air channels (or has one that did not catch any channels for me).I got one for ten bucks at RadioShack. Some of the OTA channels show disturbance when I press 'Info' on the remote.I do not know if this will be true for cable also. I have no intention of having cable, and I plan to integrate this with my Logitech revue, which I ordered this week from Amazon. We will see how that works out.The sound is not terribly good, but I always have my TV sound hooked up to the speaker, so I do not care. I am not too picky about sound too. Also, the TV software does not show information about program schedules of a particular channel. It only shows the current program, and the next one, and thats it.So, all in all, a no frills TV. Do not expect too much out of it. The price point is what won me over. I plan to combine it with a smart box, and make it as smart as I want. The price on the TV leaves enough on my wallet to go for a top notch smart box. I am not much of a cable watcher. I watch most of my stuff over the net. So, for me it was a good TV to watch netflix and stuff. I am not too happy with it, but would not go the trouble of returning it too. I can live with it.
