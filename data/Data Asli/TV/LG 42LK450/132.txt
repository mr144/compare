i read the reviews and compared prices.  the closest i could come to this was a vizio at $60 more (at a warehouse club store).  i have a 32' vizio and it is great.  but i took a chance on this lg.  some of the negative reviews worried me.  (i always read them first!)delivered in less than a week -- free ship.easy to attach to the stand -- but the booklet (which covers multiple models) is not so much help.  so you read, look, intuit and do your best. turns out to be a stable stand and it swivels!liked that it has 2 separate AV receptors for composite cables -- red, yellow, green prongs.the picture was good and came on quickly. (tried out some optional settings, but like the default best.) no bad pixils, no problems.the negative reviews about some brown plastic strip along the bottom worried me beforehand.  LOL  NOT a problem!this 5 star review is incomplete:  the tv is new.  it needs to work just like new for years and years to really deserve the stars.  we'll see.  but it is off to a good start.  it delivers a lot for the money.
