Ordered and received this back in April 2012.  Did not take it out of the box until Nov 2012 for a number of reasons, mainly:  those old big, bulky TV's are heavy and difficult to move until you get some help. This TV is worse than TCL product. I Am very happy with the picture quality.As usual with this TV and the Sony Bravio:  would welcome some input on a better sound quality without having to buy a sound bar.
