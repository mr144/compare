My first Flatscreen HD TV, but did a lot of comparisons before pulling the trigger on the 37' model. Not to big, not to small. Did not want the 'TV' to be the defining object in my living room, but wanted the 'gee wiz' factor a large screen TV. The 37 is perfect for this.After some adjusting, the picture is wonderful, sharp and clear, with very good skin tones. That's the 'bar' for a digital TV, how well it projects accurate looking skin tones.  Turned off most of the dynamic settings of the very extensive adjustment menus offered. A nice feature, but can be a maze to work through. Once set, a great picture. Sound is good for a flat screen, better than many others, but if your turn on the simulated surround sound (which is pretty nice) you cannot have 'Clearvoice', which is also a nice audio feature. If you listen to music on this TV you will want to invest in a sound system. There is only a digital audio out, but it does have an analog earphone jack, which I am using with my old computer sound system. Not the best, but I already had it sitting around.All in all, if this TV does not go south anytime in the next few years, it will be a great HDTV for less than $450.
