I went and picked the tv up from Best Buy to ensure I got an IPS panel, look on the box for the 'Y' version 'CUSY' for the IPS. The picture is great, there's no noticeable input lag in MW3 on my Xbox 360. I researched all day before I made a decision and went out and bought this, I wanted the least amount of input lag possible for the price and this is it.. if you get the IPS panel. The colors are very good, but the blacks are not as dark as they could be. The viewing angle is pretty good on the IPS, colors stay the same even from an extreme angle, although you'll see the white backlight more, still very much viewable. The built-in speakers are better than I expected, of course not great they are very decent and fine for light TV watching. My standard def DirecTV connected with composite cables looks pretty bad, I expected this though. It seems no newer tvs have S-video unfortunately, so I am forced to watch TV and play older consoles through composite.. It does have 2 individual composite inputs (not linked to component), 2 component, 3 HDMI, USB, RF, VGA, digital and optical outputs, and a 3.5mm output. Other than the standard definition and black levels, I love this tv and I recommend it to anybody who wants a tv for gaming with little to NO input lag..BUT, be sure to go into the shop and get the 'Y' version with an IPS panel, I have heard the VA panels lag substantially more and have worse viewing angles.  Note: I have my Xbox 360 connected through component at the moment, running 1080p with no lag in 60FPS games.. I have yet to try HDMI but I should have a cable coming soon and I expect it to be lagless.
