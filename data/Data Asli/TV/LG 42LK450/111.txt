I purchased a 47' LCD 3D TV for our family room and loved it. When my wife lobbied for an HD TV for the bedroom I looked first at the largest size that I could put in the space available and found the perfect size from LG.  It's picture is great, the sound is excellent and the installation was very easy. We both love it for our late evening viewing.
