I bought this TV during Black Friday as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  I knew I would not be disappointed because I had an LG TV in the past.  I had no problem assembling the TV (base + screen) and programing was very simple.  There are plenty of features that allow for enhanced viewing.  Buy this TV, I promise you will be glad you did.
