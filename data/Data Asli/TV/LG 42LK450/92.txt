I bought this TV as an upgrade from the 32 inch 2010 model (32LD450), both of them have been great TVs for my relatively basic needs. I did like to note that I mainly use my TV as a large computer monitor (it is hooked up to a media center PC for Hulu/Netflix) and for occasional rounds of Xbox.The Good:- Nice picture with good contrast and rich color- Easy to use (LG's menu system and remote control are quite intuitive)- Full 1080p- Plenty of inputs- No paying for extraneous features if you do not need them (120Hz, Internet apps, etc.)- AffordableThe Bad:- LG went from hardware buttons on the side of the TV to touch-sensitive symbols on the front, sometimes it is a little difficult to tell if you have hit the button you want.- The eco-friendly power-saving feature is pretty much worthless. It either dims the screen so much you can barely see what's on, or jarringly goes back and forth between bright/dark. I wanted a TV, not a strobe light.The Ugly:- It's hard to tell from the picture, but there's a brown plastic sripe that runs along the bottom of the front bezel that looks like a cheap sticker. Gross. The 2010 model was much cleaner looking with a plain black bezel.
