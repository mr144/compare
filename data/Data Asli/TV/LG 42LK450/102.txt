The TV is great -- Verizon FIOS is the problem.  When I first hooked it up I was terribly disappointed in the color and the clarity since I still did not have the high definition setbox from Verizon.  Once I got that -- what a difference.  The only problem still not resolved is getting the Verizon remote to control the TV no matter what I try - it does not seem to recognize LG product code.  But that is not the LG problem -- that is Verizon support (which is at best minimal).  I would recommend that you pay the extra and get the LED version -- if you are not looking straight at the TV the picture is fuzzy.
