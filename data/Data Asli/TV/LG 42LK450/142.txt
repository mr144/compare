Ok, I bought this TV for my dad for Christmas, it came and he loved it but it had a cluster of dead pixels in the center of the screen. I was heart broken and had to return it, now why would I rate it 5 stars after that. Well Amazon sent me a new one right away at the same price as I purchased the first one, even though it had gone up in price. The new one came in a matter of days and it was perfect. I have a top of the line UN55D8000 Samsung and am an audio and videophile and still I was very impressed with this little TV. Great image blur reduction, great color accuracy, plenty of inputs and sleek design.Very happy and thank you amazon
