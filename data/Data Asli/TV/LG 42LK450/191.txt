I have to admit that my cousin had been quite right about its specifications that has made the picture sharper and clearer than expected. But also to be pleased with its manual having simpler instructions about its operations as well as to enable me to achieve the local and distant channels upon scanning. Notably to be delighted to be able to receive PBS-TV channel from OKC station when that from Dallas/Fort Worth could not because of 'snowy' pictures. As well as to be worth its cost with special discount and free shipping despite tax included during the holidays! Also, to have had it delivered to my house on the day expected from California.
