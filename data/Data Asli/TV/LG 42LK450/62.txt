Bought this tv almost a year ago, and while I have been happy with the picture quality and  easy handling of settings, I constantly had a hissing or air sound coming from the tv.  Tried increasing the volume on my cable box and decreasing it on the tv, but still there.Just had a high def cable box installed and this sound is now gone and I have increased volume.  It may all have been due to my regular cable box?  Did find that I could not use the energy saver mode, as picture too dark at night after turning lights off in the room...so useless for me and once I changed that setting, picture was fine.All in all, a great tv for the price!
