I received our 42' LG in the morning and I did not have time to set it up until that night..I tell what, once it found all the channels and we did all the settings..the first image channel was DIGITAL CABLE..wow !!!! We are nothing less than thrill, and made all the waiting for the right television, worth every minute of it..if you want a great television... man !! this one is the way to go...We Love it !!
