This review is from: LG 42LK450 42-Inch 1080p 60 Hz LCD HDTV (Electronics)42LK450-SA (do not think it is an IPS panel)I have recived this TV last saturday.Mainly used with PC, and cable box.1) The plastics looked some filmsy to me.2) The screen delivers very very very crisp and good colors for HD content. (HD cable box, PC, WD TV LIVE)3) Sepeakers sounds week, but enough.4) Optical out is great to linsten media from USB drive on the external receiver.5) Professional image settings options !!!!!I have faced 2 issues.1)when connecting the PC.(HDMI)The screen has black borders and the text from PC was blurred, this is because the pixel mapping is not 1:1 (even if the res is 1080p) then I used 'just scan' setting, but did not work to me initiallyBut now, magically, 2 minutes after the windows desktop is displayed when the PC starts, the image increase automatically to fit in the whole screen......I do not understand why i have to wait 2 minutes to have the screen automatically streched.After that the pixel mapping is 1:1 and everything is cristal clear.1) Connected to an HD calbe box PACE DC550D (HDMI)Initially worked fine, but once you turn the TV off and then on, there is no sound from the TV.To make it work again I have to reset the Cable box, or change the imput to another one and then come back to the correct one. It seems in this way the connection to the cable box is reseted.The Cable box works fine with my old 37' LG.I guees it is a TV software failure or a kind of noncompatibility.Used with the WD TV LIVE this does not happnes.Note: out of the box the image is not so good and too bluish !! Initially I thought O my...what a piece of c...But after a minimun image tune I can say the image quality is really very very good.Here it costs, 1000 american dollars ( yes and it is the cheapest 42' I could find)After rebates and discounting taxes I have it for 600 american dollars, for this money you can buy the most cheaper 32' here)Some drawbacks but still a good TV with a very good image.-----------------
