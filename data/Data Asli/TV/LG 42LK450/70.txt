I was a little sceptical about buying a TV online sight unseen, but after reading the positive reviews on a few websites I took the plunge. Amazon made it easy with the price, it shipped in about two days. The picture is stunning, and the size is just right. With attenna TV it takes a while getting used to programming and re-programming channels that decide to come in that week. I like the fact you can use one remote through HDMI to control a LG dvd/blu ray. The only complaints I have are if you switch to power-save mode, the screen gets pretty dark and makes it look like the set is getting ready to die on you, not an issue if you do not go to power save mode. And the speakers are not that loud on some channels. All in all it was a great deal and plays excellent.
