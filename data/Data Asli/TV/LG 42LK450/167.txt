This is the first flat screen LCD TV I have ever purchased (yes I was still surviving on the classic 90's box TV's!), and I must say, this has been a fantastic purchase. I ordered it for $475, and the identical set was at $520 at Best buy (taxes etc included). I chose free super saving shipping, and the delivery estimate was set between 5th and 10th January (I ordered on 26th December). I was pleasantly surprised when I learnt that the set was delivered to me literally THREE days later on the 29th! Early new years present!Regarding set up, this TV is incredibly easy to set up. I actually managed it all entirely on my own, from unpacking to lifting to mounting the set on the stand. The setup itself was incredibly easy as the auto tune options self generated when I first switched it on. Within a few minutes, I was up and running. I read some of the other reviews about the sound quality and sharpness etc - I found for now that my sharpness has been set to 80, and I am set to Sports picture mode. I suspect I will have to continue playing around with the various display features this TV offers, but all in all, this was an incredibly simple process. I would highly recommend this TV for the price range - nothing like a sleek LG LCD TV!
