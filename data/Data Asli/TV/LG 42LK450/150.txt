Everything about this TV is very is good. The only trouble I have with this TV is that it can not recognize an external Hard drive larger than 1 TB. (Infact this is the case with many other TVs and also with my Roku 2 XS player as well, So I would not crib about this much).Through the HDMI cable you can connect to your Computer, Roku player etc., and the USB port will let you play the content from an external Hard drive or a Pen drive. The built in media player is very good and has all the controls required.The picture quality is very good too.For $500 this is a very good TV..
