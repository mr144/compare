I recently purchased an Insignia 37 inch lcd from BESTBUY for a super price of $299.I returned it because i could not adjust it to my liking.Either the picture was to bright or the dark scenes to dark.I returned it and picked up this set because of all the stellar reviews.At first i was very disappointed with this set also.The settings out of the box had everything very muted and washed out.For $100 more i thought i made a BIG mistake but after tweaking ALL the settings i found the sweet spot.Now i am very content with the choice i made.This set has an AWESOME PICTURE as long as you realize you will have to make adjustments.Do not forget to protect your investment with a SQUARETRADE WARRANTY.
