I was surprised a refurb TV had a 2 yr warranty. It turns out that supposed warranty is useless since they wont answer their phone and will not respond to emails. The tv lasted around a month Now the screen blinks on and off. Initial response was good and I was sent a replacement part with instructions to call for a technician to install it when it arrived, When it arrived I called the number I was given and no one answers. The general  help number says I must call the level 2 support number which will not answer. I was given a manager's number, but she does not return calls. They also stopped responding to emails.
