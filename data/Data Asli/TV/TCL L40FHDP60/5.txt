I'll be honest at this price? I was not expecting a whole lot, my mom hung onto her old 25 inch CRT until the thing was more B&W than color so frankly anything would have been better...boy was I pleasantly surprised! Great picture with rich color, plenty of inputs, good heavy stand, its just a great TV. The picture is good enough I am seriously debating picking up the 32 inch model to replace my 22 inch monitor, the picture is THAT good and clear.
