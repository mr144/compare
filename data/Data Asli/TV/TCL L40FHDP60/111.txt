For what I needed this tv for, which is essentially watching tv, it is fantastic! I am not a huge gadget person and do not really care about surround sound or anything like that. I live in a smaller apartment and this is the perfect size for my living room. Essentially, this is a great, basic tv and I recommend it to everyone!
