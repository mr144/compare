I got this on cyber monday so paid just around $200Even if it were not on sale, it is a good value at around $225 as it comes with a 2 year warranty.After doing the initial channel scan, it works perfectly.Got it for my 91 year old dad who does not like to read through manuals and it is perfect.The sharpness and colors were as good as any other that I have seen. I am not a tv perfectionist but to me, the vibrant colors were great without looking artificial.Howard
