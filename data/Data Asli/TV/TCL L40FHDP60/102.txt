I was skeptical at first of the brand; however, even COSTCO is selling this brand. The box arrived well packaged and protected. This TV is surprisingly light. Set up was easy and took less than 5 minutes. The stand easily attaches to the television. The picture is fabulous, bright rich colors. The remote is not complicated. With a 2 year warranty I feel safe. I highly recommend this Television. In fact, I am so pleased that this evening I ordered another identical TV.
