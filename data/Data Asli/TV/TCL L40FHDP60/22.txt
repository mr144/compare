Great product, I opened the box put the base plate an then set the Tv, beautyfull colors good sound, have a lot of connections including 2 HDMI, and the wonder when I set the scan chanell was surprised cause found the cable chanels and also the new digital tv in my country. For the price and quality I give 5 stars, only 200 bucks for this amazing TV SET
