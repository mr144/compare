This TV was highly rated on CNET and I decided that the large screen TV fad has clearly moved past its early days. I was worried buying something so large and technical essentially &#34;through the mail&#34; but it arrived fine, no gouges in the box or cracked screen or anything like that. Actually FedEx Ground insisted on handing to directly to me...they were not going to just &#34;leave&#34; the package. I am very happy with this purchase.
