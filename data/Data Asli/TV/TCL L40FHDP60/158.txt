I purchased the TCL L40FHDP60 40-Inch HDTV a month ago.I do not know what to think? I was a bit fearful at the 60hz refresh rate before the purchase and that appears to be a potential problem. I should find out tonight watching a football game, but so far during major movement on the screen there is a video cloud or ghost that follows the movement. Also, from the first day after setup, after about an hour of use there will be a snapping sound from the audio and the video signal will momentarily go away then return and re-lock, only to do it again thirty minutes later. I wrote the TCL website to ascertain what kind of problem this may or may not be, after a week I still have not heard a response. So much for customer service. This TV does have pretty good audio and was easy to set up, even with using the DISH Universal remote.
