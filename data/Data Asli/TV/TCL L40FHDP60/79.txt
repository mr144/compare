I have been trying to look at real reviews for the THIRTY TWO INCH MODEL and I have gone through 6 FRIGGING PAGES OF REVIEWS AND SAW ABOUT FIVE OF THEM.ALL THE REST ARE FOR THE 40' MODEL AND THIS IS NOT EVEN THE CORRECT PRODUCT.AMAZON THIS IS JUST THE MOST STUPID THING I'VE EVER SEEN THAT YOU LUMP ALL YOUR REVIEWS TOGETHER FOR A BRAND NAME.PLEASE, TROLLS STAY AWAY AND DON'T RESPOND WITH SOME LAME RESPONSE, IT IS A LEGITIMATE COMPLAINT.
