When I got the TV there was a dead pixel in the middle. I was apprehensive about dealing with the return process, but Amazon was amazing! They sent us a new TV and gave me a 30 day window in which to send back the defective one. This TV is great for the price, good quality picture, the blacks are pretty black, although there is some variation/gray tones. But really, for the price this is great. It's super slim and the base is very attractive. We hooked it up to Windows Media Center without issue.
