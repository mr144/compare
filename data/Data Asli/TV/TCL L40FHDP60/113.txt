A friend of mine has a 40-inch TCL and loves it.  Great picture (1080p) and price.  Compatible with local cable (Cox).  My experience has not been good.  The first one sent to me simply did not work at all.  Completely, utterly, black screen.  Technical support for the manufacturer promised to have a second level tech call, but if they did, it was by shouting out their window.  There's no indication that a call was made to my phone.  I called Amazon, and a new one was shipped out, promptly.  What I discovered was that the remote is not compatible with AT&T U-verse, our cable outfit.  AT&T tried all the codes it knew to use, and the manufacturer's technical support suggested a couple and then fizzled out.  Even the rather paltry owner's manual warns that its remote is not compatible with many cable systems.  It sure is not with mine, and I wish I had known before I ordered that it was not compatible with AT&T U-verse.  If you like to be wedded to remotes, it is ok, but I think it is a pain, and there were alternatives that probably would have been compatible, like a Toshiba, for about the same price.  Oh and to crown this fiasco, the original TV was arrived back where it came from on October 2.  Today is the 24th, and I got an email from Amazon telling me that they would be sending me a label to return the TV.  SNAFU, anyone?
