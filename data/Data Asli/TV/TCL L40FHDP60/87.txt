The television's picture quality is sharp, crisp, and very detailed. I use this as a bedroom TV and probably sit too close to it, but it is just so massive. Playing games on it is a joy, you kind of fall into the screen and feel like you are shooting real-life terrorists.Have it hooked up to an old Logitech Z-2300 speaker system, which gives games and movies quite a bit of 'oomph'. The built-in speakers are not terrible but I just wanted a little more quality so I went with the 2.1 system.I would not use this for my living room or anything but this is a great bedroom/game room television. Wait for Black Friday for this television's price to fall quite a bit.
