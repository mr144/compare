Shipped and packaged well and fast!  Received 2 business days after placing order...opened up the box, put base on the TV and it was ready to go in a couple seconds.  When you first turn it on there is a little lag then you see the screen TCL flash up, after it is one it quickly changes channels and the screen/resolution is actually REALLY nice!  Granted I have only had this TV for less than 24hrs, but we are so far pleased with it.  WE are using it as our bedroom TV as the 32in is just the right size for the bedroom (had a little 19in and OMG terrible to watch movies on)  The RCA hook ups on the back are a little awkward to find/plug in the DVD player, but really that is my only &#34;complaint&#34;.  The speakers sound good, but if you do have a fan going or something like that in the bedroom you will need to crank the volume up a bit.  All and all it was a great b-day present for my hubby and makes a great edition to the bathroom!
