I was really pleased to get this TV for under 300. bucks.  The picture is excellent when watching DVD or Blue Ray.  I have a surround sound system so I can not vouch for the sound quality.  It was a little bit tricky attaching the pedestal.  I had no problem with the rest of the set-up.  I would definitely buy again.
