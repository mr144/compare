I bought this same television about eight months ago and this new one is definitely not as well equipped.  The new set only has one av plug.  Not good at all if you have several items that HAVE to run on AV.  Also, there is no indicator on the set that shows that the set has been turned on with the remote.  Because of the time delay factor in the set being turned on after the remote is touched, the set will be turned off again because it is so slow.  The rest of the features are as good if not better than the older set.
