Saw this for 399, then 349, then 319. Finally clicked it at 299 and it is good but when the screen is dark there are four large clouds in each corner. Allmost returned it and still thinking but during 80% of the viewing it looks great. On a dark scene though you really see the lower quality of this set. Bought a 37inch Vizio for my son and it looks much better on dark scenes but cost me 560. The base and frame look great just wish the clouding was not so bad.If anyone knows a way to get ride of the clouding please let me know. And I did also like to know if this is the norm for this LCD.*****Received the replacement and its about 50-60% better. The backlight bleed is much better than the first one. There is a little backlight bleed still visable but it is so much better and I feel I can live with this one. So if you get one with excessive backlight bleeding return it for another, hopefully you will end with one that is much easier to live with. Thanks for all the comments and help with this**** Changed my 3 stars to 4! Most thanks to Amazon and the members.
