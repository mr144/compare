I bought this TV in Nov of 2011.  In 6 months it failed.  It took more than 2 months to get them to take the TV in for repairs.  So, they have had my TV since early August......it is now almost Thanksgiving.  They tell me that they do not know when the new parts are coming in......THAT'S IT.....CRICKETS.....IT HAS A 2-YEAR WARRANTY!!!  NOTHING!!  Amazon has refused to help, btw......usually they are very good, but not with this.I realize that people exaggerate on the internet.  This is no exaggeration.  These people are shysters.  Do not believe them about the warranty.  I am going to start a website warning people about TCL.  DO NOT BUY TCL!!UPDATE:  After Thanksgiving (they had my TV for almost 5 months!!), they sent me a replacement......refurbished, I suppose......WAS NOT NEW.  Anyway, it was ok FOR about one month.  THE REPLACEMENT TV HAS A LARGE WHITE LINE DOWN THE MIDDLE NOW!!!!!  Are you kidding me?  I seriously want to give up.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!
