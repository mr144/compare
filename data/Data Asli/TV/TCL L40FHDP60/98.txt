Great picture, incredible bargain. We decided to upgrade our TV right before California started imposing taxes on online purchasing. After a lot of research, this TV was the best bargain. Incredible price, great picture. First Blu-ray we watched was &#34;How to train your dragon&#34;, and the colors and clarity were amazing. I have not done a lot of research about 1080p, or pixels or LCD and LED, I just went for the TV that was the best value for my family. And this TV, was the winner. Great picture quality, easy set-up, and a the best bang for your buck. Thanks for making a great, quality product.
