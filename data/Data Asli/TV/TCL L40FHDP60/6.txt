When we first moved into our house last year, our largest TV was a 32&#34; HDTV that we had in our bedroom. After we moved, we have a bit of extra money so decided to invest in larger televisions. We purchased this one for our bedroom and have been very impressed. The price was too hard to pass up and after 7 months, have had no problems with the TV yet.
