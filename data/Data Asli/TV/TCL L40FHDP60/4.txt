This is a horrible product.  From the start we have had issues turning on the TV.  We initially thought it was the cable provider, but it was not.  It takes up to an hour for the TV to start working once it is turned on.  We have talked to Amazon several times trying to return the TV (of course by the time we figured out that the TV was faulty, the return period had expired).  We have not received any satisfaction regarding our complaints.Do not purchase his TV!!
