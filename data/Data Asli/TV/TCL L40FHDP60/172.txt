When I hooked up my computer with HDMI I realized that about 5% of the picture edges were cropped and started worrying that the physical resolution is less than claimed. The menu system did not offer a solution, the manual neither. Eventually I found out that the remote control's navigation arrows function as zoom selectors when outside the menu system and the 'no overscan' option fixes the problem. Tested and all the claimed resolution is there, I am very happy with this TV.
