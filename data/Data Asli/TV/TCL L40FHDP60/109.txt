I ordered this for my son at college and I was quite impressed.  I thought getting a 720 would hinder the HD quality of the TV and I have to say it did not.  It was shipped quickly and arrived in a few days.  We hooked it up and the visual is amazing.  Even though the sound quality is not as bad as some have mentioned in these reviews, because in his dorm room it sounds just fine.The only downfall of this system is the TV stand was a little hard to figure out, even after reading the instructions.  It took us a few tries to finally get it right, but overall I rate this TV quite high for the price.  Great product, great service and very good quality and you can not lose with this TV.
