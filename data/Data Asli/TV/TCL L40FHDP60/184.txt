I guess you get what you pay for. I should have known there was a catch with the price being so low. I always thought that being a woman I was not too obsessed about TV picture qualities and would not spend the money to get an HD TV, but after this TV now I know why the picture quality matters. It's just awful, almost blurry. There is also this high pitched noise when I pause my TV. I can not hear it when the TV is playing but it is annoying to have the high pitched noise whenever I pause it. I recommend spending a little more money for a decent quality TV.
