This is a great affordable TV. We moved from MA to TN and sold our TV to our neighbor before we left. We ended up researching a lot of TV's and stumbled upon this item. It was a brand we never heard of, but figured we could utilize the return poilcy if there were any issues with it. Well, it is been almost a year and the only real issue we have is the sound quality. It's not the best, not the worst, but it could be better. The picture is good, it is easy to configure, and has enough ports for gaming systems. I would suggest looking into a sound bar or surround system to make this TV better. It's a great TV for the price though.
