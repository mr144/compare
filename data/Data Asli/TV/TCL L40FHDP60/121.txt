I bought this TV several months ago and it starts to have white lines shinning on the screen a month ago. I called the secondary custmer sevrice to fix the problem for me and they said they will give me a replacement and prepaid label. However, after a month, I still not receive any TV box and prepaid label. I called the cusomer service again, but they never pick up phone again. It always the voice mail box. I called the primary custmer service, they said the service lane has some problems need to be fixed. But after two weeks, still no body pick up the phone. The primary custer service said I should keep call them until they pick up and there is no other options.I am really unhappy with TCL and I will never buy anything from themI strongly recommend people not to buy this one even though it is cheaper. You will be involved in the returning issues and bad custmer service!.
