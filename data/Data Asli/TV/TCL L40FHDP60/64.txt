I am having almost the exact same experience as Clay. The TV worked for a couple months Aug/Sept. Wo not turn on in Oct - Very hard to get to customer service line. After many attempts and much wasted time, I got through to customer service. After many more attempts, received my parts in Nov. Called and was told I would get a return call for service, but no one has ever called. It takes 20-45 minutes to get to talk to someone on the phone if you are not disconnected after waiting... very frustrating. Amazon should drop this manufacturer's products!
