Seriously... I do not know who is to blame, Amazon, TCL, or UPS but I ordered this TV, it arrived all beat up and the screen was cracked.  Returned it.  Amazon tried to ship the replacement UPS ground (I have prime) instead of 2-day, so I had to fight with them about that -- then #2 arrived and will not power on.  100% DOA.  Lesson learned.  Buy TV's locally and get them to price match Amazon.
