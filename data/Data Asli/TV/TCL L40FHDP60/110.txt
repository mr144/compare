The TV is not compatible with the standard remote control Comcast provide with the digital adapters (that you are force to us), it will not control the volume in the TV so you will have to be with two remote controls, the description does not alert you of that, only a small three lines hidden inside the manual, that said it MAY not be compatible with cable or universal remote controllers.
