The first one I got I returned the same day I got it......I was going through the adjustments and all of a sudden, vertical lines and then blackness.So, now I am on my 2nd one, and I have found a problem......when the volume is in 'Auto Volume Control' is turned on, the volume spikes......I'll call next week.........pain in the you know what.Oh, on my 1st one,  I called TCL (major pain) and spoke to someone in their tech department,  he told me it would 4-6 weeks before a tech could come out to repair it, note, no trying to work through the problem,  and I should just return it to Amazon.For what its worth. .....  oh by the,  picture is really good,  a bit off on the blacks, but for the price,  awesome.
