The company will not respond to numerous emails and the phone number rings then goes busy.The setup settings will not stay in memory after setting/changing them. The tv does retain settings made nearly a year ago but will not rewrite them. I can change them but only until the tv is turned off.I have tried factory reset- unplug for 5 minutes then plug back in. It will not wipe old data and reset.There is a year left on warranty- purchased from Amazon Dec 21, 2011 and I have been trying to contact them for six weeks. Nothing from them.
