I am a college student who just moved into a room by myself and naturally, that meant I needed to get a TV. I had a few things I was looking for:  1080p  more than 32 inches  at least 2 HDMI inputs  Under 400 dollars, but the less the betterWith the budget I was working with, I figured I did be able to scoop up no bigger than a 37 incher. Imagine my surprise when I come to Amazon to find a 300 dollar TV that meets all the above requirements and comes with a two year warranty and 40 inches of screen. It only took me another 30 minutes of online window shopping to realize that I found a good deal and I ordered it that night.I have had it for a month now and could not be happier. The picture quality is great, whether from my Xbox, PC, or cable. Keeping in mind they are just built-in TV speakers, they too work flawlessly. I thought with the money I was saving that I would maybe throw in for a used surround sound set, but I did not even feel the need.Overall, I am thrilled with this purchase. The icing on the cake was 3.99 next day shipping. Thank you Amazon Student Prime.If you are on a budget like me and looking to get the best value for your money, you might be concerned with quality and reliabiliy. From its glass stand to its performance, this TV is definity worth the money. And with its warranty, it becomes a no-brainer., If this was a class, it did be an easy A. Take it. You will not regret it
