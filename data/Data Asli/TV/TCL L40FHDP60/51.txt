This is a great TV!  Terrific picture & looks stylish!  The only problem I have is that since it is not a &#34;top brand&#34;, I cannot program my cable remote to adjust the sound volume.  Sound volume has to be changed by the TV remote which means I have 2 remotes.  Not a huge issue, but annoying still!  The cable provider said they continuously update their list of products, so hopefully this brand will be listed soon!  I recommend this product to everyone!  I love it!!
