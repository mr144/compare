Worst purchase ever. TV worked great for five days, then slow to power up. Got worse dailey until would not start at all. After  MANY phone calls to warranty center, they finally sents parts. Never did schedule a repairman to come as they said. I replaced the two boards myself, worked fine for four days, now will not receive a signal. I am ready to take it out in the desert and use it for target practice, but I do not want to clean up the mess. Found out TCL is made by Vizio. I refuse to buy either of these brands ever again. Over three months wasted on this. I have had enough. Spend a little more and buy a reputable name brand. Inow believe TCL stands for 'Total Crap Load'
