When I first bought the TV I was reluctant to put my money in the hands of an unknown brand. After a month and something else with the TV, that feeling is gone. I am very pleased with my purchase.What I liked the most: I love the design of the TV, it is a beautiful piece of furniture, the glass base and the edges in a dark-wood style fit great in my living room.The image and sound are solid, it totally holds up.But, it is a cheap TV, and as such there is a trade off:* Comcast technician was not able to program the TV so that the Comcast controller could command the TV. The result is that I need to have both controllers at hand when I am watching TV.* The TV controller and the menu screen are not as nice and luxury as those in any other TV.I recommend this TV for the untrained purchaser, those who need a TV that properly fulfills the primary functions and that are willing to save some cash out of not-functionality features.
