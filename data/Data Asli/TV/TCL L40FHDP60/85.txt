When I saw this i was like 'get outta town'. A 40 inch1080p for 3 bills? I am a contractor and these motel TV's just do not cut it, so I always buy a Flat screen, then Goodwill it when I leave town. This puppy is going with me when I leave . The color and clarity are simply stunning. I have 4 LCD'S now, and I plan to promote this one to my bedroom and put the 32 inch Samsung to the bathroom or something. To cut to the chase, buy it. If the price or off-brand name put it out of the running for you, you are a schmuck.
