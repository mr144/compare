It's a pretty good TV. I bought the 40-inch size and feel it fit pretty good with my bedroom. I can not really tell any image quality differences between TCL and Sony or Samsung, but I can tell the price are hundreds cheaper than Sony and Samsung.I give it 4 stars because the price of this item just turn 40 bucks cheaper than the price I bought it and on the day it arrives at my home..
