Ordered 2 days ago and received in two days shipping using amazon prime. satisfied. It's easy enough to put it together. Just need a screwdriver for 4 screws on bottom. first thing I noticed about the TV, the default sound of the tv is okay, turn it up to max and it is fine but sound is better if you use your own speakers.  will update in a few month.
