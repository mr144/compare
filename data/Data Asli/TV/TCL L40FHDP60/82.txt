We were a bit uneasy about buying a rather unknown brand that had such a low price, but I read a number of reviews on this site and was encouraged to buy it.  It turns out we like it very much.  Everything came intact in the shipment and putting it together was easy except for the tricky connection of the base with the flatscreen.  The directions should be clearer about that. The picture is excellent and the set is quite attractive.  We are hoping that it will be reliable over the long run but have nothing to report about that yet.  My only criticism thus far is that the sound is rather thin and tinny, but I suppose that could be remedied by hooking the TV up to better speakers.  All and all, it is a terrific buy.
