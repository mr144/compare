This is a surprisingly good TV. After our expensive previous flat screen went all plaid after about five years of use, we decided that spending so much money may have been a mistake. The TLC 40-inch TV confirmed that. The pictures are fine, as judged by my eyes. Sometimes the sound seems a little imperfect, but that appears to be a problem of the broadcaster rather than the receiver.At other times, the sound is great. We input the computer as well as the cable, and the pictures are great for both. I did buy this television again. And if it goes plaid after five years, I will still have gotten my money's worth.
