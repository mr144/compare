Even though the price was right, I am disappointed with the image quality. Also, I have to use the video/audio inputs instead of coaxial cable to get a half decent picture. The mounting screws are not correct, so the TV is a bit wobbly. I bought this because of fairly high ratings from CR, but I do not agree with what they found. Also, trying to navigate the setup menu is very difficult.
