4 stars for meeting my expectations, but not exceed them. Unlike other reviews, I had no problem with my cable remote working with the TV, I did not have to do any programming.  I was not smart enough to buy an HDMI cable so I can not review the HD but as far as standard viewing, this is fine.  The sound is great!  So far the only issues I have are:1.  A VERY tight fit on the cable coax.  It's hard to work it in such an awkward and small area.2. The remote must be pointed directly at the sensor; not just aimed at the TV.3. The function buttons on the TV itself are irritating.  They do not seem to turn on/off the tv or do channel up/down. It does adjust the volume though.  Good Luck if you lose the remote.Otherwise, the value far surpassed any minor issues I have.
