I have had for only two weeks.  I am a senior and the setup was very easy i.e. attach the base to the television.  It is not too heavy.  There was one cable for me to attach to the back of the tv and the cable box.  With the help of the cable company everything else was duck soup and now I have a wonderful great picture 40 inch tv.  I can not image going back to viewing a standard televison; HD is the only way to go.  In the back of my mind I also know I have that two year warranty should anything go wrong.
