I purchased this television just before Christmas of 2011. It arrived in record time and worked perfectly right up until the middle of February. That was when a vertical dead pixel line appeared about 3 inches from the left side of the screen. Taking advantage of my 2-year warranty, I filed a claim with the appropriate parties and waited. While I will point out that the customer service folk were inconsistent in replying to my phone calls and emails, ultimately a box arrived with instructions and prepaid postage for sending the television back to the service center. The replacement television arrived a month later, however it was damaged in transit, so it had to be returned. This part I do not hang on the customer service people, but it meant waiting another month for a replacement television. Long story short: I went from March to July without a television while processing this claim. Ultimately the new television arrived and worked just as well as the first... until November. The TV turned off unexpectedly, worked inconsistently for a matter of hours, then refused to power on at all. I sent an email to the customer service center where they informed me that this problem fell under the previous claim. They said they would send me a new power board and that when it arrived they would send a technician to install it. The board arrived as promised, so I felt pretty good about the claim. It has now been two months and I have not received any response to my emails. I have the television and the replacement board in my possession, but they will not reply to send the technician out to install it. So I am left with a useless 40-inch television in the corner and a box of parts I can not install. I will not be buying any more televisions from TCL, and probably never from Amazon again. Mailing a television for service is just too much of a hassle. Lesson learned.
