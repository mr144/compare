Did not know what to expect from such a low priced TV, but so far we are pleased with it. Very easy to set up, and a good picture. The sound seems a bit tinny, but its not a problem in a small room. Besides, you could easily add a couple of speakers for better sound if desired. All in all, its a great TV for the price!
