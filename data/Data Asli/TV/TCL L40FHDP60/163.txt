I was so amazed with this TV that I bought a second.  The HD is so clear and crisp that I had no idea what the family had been missing.  It took all of 5 minutes to unpack, screw 4 screws into the base, plug the HDMI cable to the Dish receiver and electric plug. That was it.  No more to do or put together.  The free HD channels on Dish Network and this TV are the best buys around.I read a critique about not having sound outputs.  This is TOTALLY false and I wish people had a bit of knowledge before speaking.  tThe TV has a headphone jack out.  For 2 dollars you can get the 1/8 to RCA connector from Amazon here; http://www.amazon.com/3-5mm-Mini-Plug-Computer-Stereo/dp/B000LMFS7M/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1345918624&sr=1-1&keywords=1%2F8+to+rcaif you need a different connector they make and sell everything possible that you need to connect a stereo, surround sound system or just extra speakers here on Amazon.  Bad review it was and should be pulled as it is very misleading.  You CAN easily hook up surround sound and there is a Cinematic setting in the setup menu.SO;  You can use RCA plugs INTO the TV, You can use HDMI into the TV, You can use cable into the TV.  You can even connect your computer monitor to it with the pin plug.  My kids download movies from NetFlix and then attach the laptop to the big screen to view them.  It even has a USB connector into it so you can view photos or listen to MP3's.  you CANNOT view videos through the USB that I know of.Why pay 300 more for the same quality TV.  The 2 year warranty is worth 100 dollars if you had to purchase it.  TCL may be unknown but they certainly have great quality, a great picture and Amazon delivers fast.  Go Amazon!!
