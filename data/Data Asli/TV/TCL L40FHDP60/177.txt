This is a great, low priced LCD TV.  I was skeptical at first because I had never heard of the brand before, but upon further investigation I found that they had been producing several electronic brands under the RCA label in the U.S.  They are now labeling all TV's under their own label, The Creative Life (TCL).I have not had the same issues that other reviewers did.  I had no problem assembling the stand to the TV, it was quite easy actually.  I also have no issues with the quality of the speakers on the TV.  Unless you are in a huge room, I have a smaller apartment, they are more than sufficient.The only issues I have are with the connections.  There is no audio out connection, so the only way to hook up a surround sound system is to use the headphone output, which is quite unusual.  There is a usb port on the side of the TV, but it only reads mp3's and jpeg's, so no playing movies off thumb drives.  Another issue is with how slowly it powers up.  There is a period of at least 10 seconds from when you hit the power button until a picture actually appears, which is minor, but still a bit annoying.Pros: high quality picture, decent speakers, easy to set up, light weight, good looking, Energy Star rating, 2 year limited warranty, PRICE!!!Cons: limited connections, power up speed***FYI, you may run into issues setting the TV up with a universal remote since it is such a new company.  I found that the RCA codes actually work for TCL brands.  I have Comcast and found the code 11447 worked!  Good luck.
