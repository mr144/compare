We moved into the digital age this week by purchasing this TV and by upgrading to DIRECTV HD (Genie DVR). New Directv remote control would not program itself with my new TV, but I found an easy solution to the remote control issue.Since the new TV model number (L40FHDP60) was not in the list of TCL model numbers in the Directv remote control setup utility, I chose a TCL TV model number for a similar TCL set (L40FHDF12TA) that WAS listed and followed the normal setup procedure (pointing the remote at the Genie HD DVR during setup). It worked. Now I can manage everything with ONE remote.Could not be happier with my TCL TV. Great picture, great sound quality. Now if it would only make popcorn....
