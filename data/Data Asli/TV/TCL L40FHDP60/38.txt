the only problem i have with this tv is the lack of inputs for additional devices. I have my roku hooked up, but cannot have my DVD player hooked up at the same time.This may have been in the description when I purchased the TV, but I do not remember.Otherwise, I like the TV, it is as described and shipped quickly.
