Purchased this TV for my daughter for christmas. She do not open the box until she got an apartment. Bad mistake. The box was intact with on damage to it. She thought leaving it in the box would keep it safe. Upon opening the box the screen was damaged. The time to return it, as well as the warranty were no good. I have read of similar problems. I plan on ordering another one for her because the reviews are good and the price. Hope this one arrives in good condition!
