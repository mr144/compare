Never considered buying a TV over the internet. I read all the reviews both the good and the bad. TV actually arrived over night. Put the stand together with no problem followed the setup instructions and had it up and running and connected to my Dish Hopper in about. 20 minutes. Use the RCA codes to set up the Dish remote. Great picture and price.
