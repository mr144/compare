About 4 months ago I purchased a TCL 40' TV (L40FHDF12TA) from Amazon for $318 with prime free shipping. It was a great tv. It had 3 HDMI ports, 2 CMPT ports, 1 S-Video port, 2 audio video ports, tv cable input port, plus an audio output port and headphone jack. This computer was destroyed by lightning, Tuesday, Aug. 21, 2012. I looked on Amazon and that TV was no longer available but another 40' TCL that looked identical was available for $359.95, (L40FHDP60). I figured the price must have gone up but maybe it was a better model. Unfortunately it leaves much to be desired. It only has 2 HDMI ports, 1 audio video port, 1 CMPT port, a cable tv port, a USB port and a PC input port. For these reasons I would give TV a rating no higher than a 3. My first inclination was to give it a 1. I feel I got the shaft on this model. However the tv looks and sounds good but I wish I could have gotten my original tv instead.
