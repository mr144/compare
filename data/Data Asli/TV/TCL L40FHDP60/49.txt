Like most other reviewers, this is my first flat screen TV.  After reading Consumer Reports' full report on TVs I am going to stick with Sony or Panasonic. CR strongly recommends Sony and other well-established brands for LED TVs. It is not bad as a bedroom TV. I am not a gamer, but I find the sound very good. The picture is fine in terms of resolution, sharpness for many TV shows but movies with differing lighting & shows like 'Homeland' which have atmospheric scenes lose clarity & in darkened scenes. If lights are on the glare blurs the pic; I usually turn them off to see better.REMOTE/Sound: Quirks. Poor designThe remote is designed poorly & I have not yet gotten the Comcast universal remote to work. I have never seen a remote that does not have a closed captions button. If the dialogue is not distinct ill put the titles on for a few minutes & then turn them off. To get to captions one must push menu, scroll down to set-up, push set-up and scroll down to closed caption. Then go to yet ANOTHER screen to choose, captions always on, off, always on when muted. This is an extreme hassle.VOLUME:  I find I have to adjust the volume on any TV as movies seem to fluctuate in sound levels quite a bit. At least once a day, the volume display across the bottom of the screen just remains on the screen & does not go away. The only remedy is to pause what I am watching and turn the TV off and on.It's good for the price but I knew fairly soon after that I would want to buy another. Also I now realize a 42 inch screen is a necessity to watch movies in HD. 32-inches is small. Very different measurement than the old fashioned TVs.
