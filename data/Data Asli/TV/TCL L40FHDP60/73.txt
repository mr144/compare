Purchased this as a gift for our son and his wife out in the Northwest. They rave about the quality of the picture.  We bought this before Thanksgiving and quite frankly, did better on the price than had we waited another 3 weeks (it was still a great deal on BF). It was delivered as promised, which is why we love Amazon Prime.
