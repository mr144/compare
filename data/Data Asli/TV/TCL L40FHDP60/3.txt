1) Report broken TV (covered by warranty). 'Sending part, local tech will call you.'2) Two follow-ups and six weeks later, part arrives. 'Local tech will call you.'3) Two follow-ups and six weeks later, tech shows up, part does not fix problem. Tech attempts to get other part, butis told 'all technicians (on their end) are on lunch, try back in an hour.' He does so, and eventually gets other part on the way.4) Part arrives within a week! This time, I can call local tech, and today (Saturday) he uses part. Box had been written on as  didefective controller board,' but we had both been assuming they had re-used packaging. Nope; before, it would turn on (TCL splash screen and backlight present), just no actual TV or response to menu/buttons/remote. With 'new' part, does not even get that far. Old part, we at least can turn it on (though cannot turn it off). They really did deliberately ship a known-to-be-defective part.5) ??? Tech will get back to me.
