Great TV for the price.  Only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because it does not work well with my DirecTv remote.  I used the code another reviewer found 10047.  I have to use the tv remote to turn it on and off, but my DVR remote will adjust the vol.  Other than that, it is a geat tv, so far! DirecTv says they will keep trying to find a code that will work for it.I even called the company to see if they knew the codes.  They gave me 2 to try, but neither worked.  I have ordered the HMDI cable, and will up date this if it makes any difference.**UPDATE**  Got my HDMI cables and connected it.  Reprogramed my DirectTv using the code 10047 and can now use my DTV remote for vol adjustment as well as turning it on and off.  If your screen should come up blue with the 'No Signal' on it, use the TV remote to scroll thru (the channel up button)until it is back on HDMI1. Your Picture should be good to go.  At least mine was!
