This tv I great.  It is set up in the bedroom and works very nicely.  The picture looks fine and the sound quality is fine.  I do not know if there are a lot of bells and whistles as I did not care about bells and whistles when I bought this tv.  I did not set up a game system as I use this for tv watching only.  I was able to attach the stand, cable box and perform set up with no assistance - and sadly, that is a big accomplishment for me.  The one down side is that I can not sync the remotes as TCL is not recognized by Time Warner Cable.
