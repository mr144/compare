Hi All,I have had my (second) tv for a little over a week now.  I have not turned it off as I am trying to put it through its paces and make sure that it is without defect.  The first set had a row of dead pixels.  But that does not bother me for two reasons: 1) Amazon has an amazing exchange policy, and 2) TCL has a 2 year guarantee.  I guess the third reason would be that the thing was SO CHEAP!Seriously, a good tv for our kitchen at such a low price...  Thanks China!  And thank you Amazon!!!
