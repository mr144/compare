You get what you pay for and for a tv in my son's room I am happy with it.  I set out to buy a 26&#34; but for $5 more I got this &#34;no name&#34; 32&#34;.  It has worked well for the last month.  Actually I like it better than the 26&#34; toshiba I had before in his room as the TLC is more responsive to remote commands.  Such as when you cycle thru inputs some TVs hang up on a certain inputs (i.e. HDMI1 when I am trying to get to TV).  The TLC makes the changes smoothly without interruption.  I got a cheap $7 vizio universal remote (mainly to operate the apple TV) from the local walmart and was able to program in the TV by using the RCA code.  The picture is great, however, I will say I need to keep the brightness all the way down for my son's room.  I find it easy to put him down with a video for naps and at night.  I did get the brightness down to a decent level by putting brightness and contrast at 0.  I thought this was odd b/c if it is at zero the screen should be blank.  Also the brightness is customized by the input.  So switching to TV the brightness is one setting and on HDMI it is the dark setting.
