I bought this Tv exactly 1 month and 8 days ago. I did a sufficient amount of searching and this Tv seemed the best deal for the price (which at the time was $316 and I now see is $399) I read many good reviews and all seemed to sway my business towards this model over others despite concern over the surprising low price and '2 year limited warranty'. After roughly 1 month of owning this Tv and using it maybe 8-10 hours a week the color seems to have gone out. Now I do not like to spend my time trying to get a hold of the terribly unreliable company, I have better things to do with my time. For that reason I have only called customer service twice but both times they were to no avail. I was put on hold for a whole hour before I hung up. I have absolutely no intention of trying to call them again as I hate talking to customer service and TCL is by far the worst I have tried to deal with. I'll just learn from my mistake and go spend ~150 more dollars and get the same size Vizio or Samsung without this ordeal. I hope anyone who takes the time to read this will abstain from buying from this extremely unreliable company. I could have just gotten a bad egg but why take the gamble when you can put your hard earned money on something that does not have a high chance of breaking early on.
