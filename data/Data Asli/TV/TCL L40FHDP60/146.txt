This TV was a great deal for a 40'!  Amazon shipping took FOREVER but it finally arrived and I am happy with my purchase.  The picture is awesome once you make the changes recommended in previous reviews.  Also, FIOS users will need to call Verizon for the new PD remote if you want to be able to control the TCL. The older Phillips FIOS remotes do not work on TCL.  And you'll need to use the RCA or Samsung codes for this model, not the TCL code.
