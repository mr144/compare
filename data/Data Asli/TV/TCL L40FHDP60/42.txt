I bought this product last year for Christmas and there was a frozen or dead pixel (could have been 2, could not tell). I kept the tv because someone told me they would not exchange it just one bad pixel. I now have what looks like a cluster of dead pixels and a line going vertically and horizontally the length of the screen thru the bad pixels. I think the tv sucks for this to happen in a year! I want another tv to replace this defective one!
