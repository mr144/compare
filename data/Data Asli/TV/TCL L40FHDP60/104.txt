I purchased this 40 inch HDTV already knowing that TCL Televisions are great as I have 2 other Televisions from TCL, but even then I was surprised at how good this TV is! The picture is of very high quality due to the fact that it is a 1080P television and it has a good amount of volume. I turned up the volume to the max and the TV speakers work fine, they do not lose quality as you turn up the volume. This is a great TV that even comes with 2 yers of warranty. I really could not ask for more. I have not experienced any problems with it and I doubt that I will. The stand is great and it adds style to the TV and it looks nice. I also connected this TV to my computer with a VGA cable and it was great having a 40 inch computer screen in such high quality. Straight out of the box the TV was simple and easy to install and program. There really is not much else I can say, but this is definitely worth buying especially for the considerably low price compared to other 1080P TVs. I Ultimitely rate this product a perfect 5 out of 5 stars.I hope this review helped you out!
