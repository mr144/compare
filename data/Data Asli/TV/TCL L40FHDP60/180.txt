I  hesitated buying an unfamiliar named tv, but research showed me that TCL actually makes or has made tvs for major companies under the familiar company names.Coupled with Amazon's easy return policy if not satisfied, I ordered this tv.No struggles getting the tv home, and a price that could not be beat.  Highly recommended.
