This TV is good - bright, ok color clarity and range, decent features.  It really struggles with sports and action video games due to its slow refresh rate, and sometimes the colors just seem too forced.  I guess it seems like there are not enough middle colors.  The TV is not very esthetic either - just a big black rectangle with a silver trip.  I can not say much about the sound since my sound is routed through a home theater system.All in all a good, cheap, entry level TV.
