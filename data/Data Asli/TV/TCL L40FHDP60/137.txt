I was hesitant to buy a non-big name branded TV but decided to try it out since it was priced substantially lower than other LCD HDTVs for its screen size. Picture quality is amazingly crisp for the price you pay and the TV was easy to setup out of the box. The only drawback is the sound quality, which is not up to par with other name brand TVs. Overall, this TV packs a great image for its price!
