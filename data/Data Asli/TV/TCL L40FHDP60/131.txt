I do not know what i expected when i ordered TCL 40 inch lcd tv. I was looking for an inexpensive tv for sons room.Super pleased to recieve a really fine quality product. I am not a techy,but it meets all my needs,great pic,color,and sound. Would like a 3rd HDMI,but no big deal. Liked it and price ,I bought another for my bedroom,two year warranty a plus.
