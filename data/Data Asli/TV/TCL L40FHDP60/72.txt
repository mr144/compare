Bought last years model 40V87C 40-inch 1080 LCD television.  14 months into very light usage and the picture is highly distorted to the point of being unwatchable.  Another TV on the same cable box results in a watchable picture so we know it is the TV.  Contacted Hisense and their response is that it is out of warranty, too bad.  There are better TV's at comparable pricing.  I will not buy another of their products in the future.
