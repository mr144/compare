My experience with digital TV is limited since this is only the 2nd I have used.  The 1st was returned after several weeks of trying to adjust to its limitations.  The TCL received good reviews but with the notation that the color was too blue.  This was true but the set allows for many color adjustments and the picture and color are now vivid and clear.  On many programs the picture clarity is impressive depending on the source.  Getting the color adjusted required considerable trial and error.  One of the pluses is the manual of instructions, which is clear and helpful, especially in comparison to the previous set that I returned.  Set up and making adjustments are easy.  The sound also is considerably better than the set I returned but still is not great, which I understand from reviews is true of most thin TV's.  While sound adjustments are possible, the speakers must be small resulting in a tinny sound at times.  The major dissatisfaction I have with the set is the delay that occurs when turning it on and when changing channels--only a few seconds, but it seems long compared with the instantaneous reactions of my old analogue set.  But I will get used to that, and the TV I returned was even slower in this respect.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase and consider it a good buy relative to prices of other 40-inch sets.
