I had my doubts earlier on this TV because I did not know about the TCL brand, but I bought it because of the inexpensive price, and because I knew someone who had an older version of it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The colors are vivid, and the sound is not too bad.  To test it I sat two feet in front of the TV, put on my headphones, and played the blue ray version of The Avatar. I was immersed in the movie.  We use this TV at a trade show, and the pre-set screen adjustments are great to have, considering the different lighting situations at various venues.
