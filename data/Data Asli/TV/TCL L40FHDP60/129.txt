HDMI all 3 do not work after 8 months of use. Otherwise worked well so far. But since I use it as a computer monitor it is huge deal to me. I'll post how the warranty goes. I see the price dropped 20% since last week so if you are thinking of getting it. I would recommend pay 50-100 more for a brand name and do not deal with this BC bad quality controls. If they fix if fast and easy I'll  give them 3 stars but for now 1 best i can do
