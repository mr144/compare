I have had this TV for 3 weeks now and at this time I am quite happy with it.  I have a few complaints such as it seems a tad darker than normal in dark scenes but I think most of my problems have to do with not yet figuring out specific configuration settings.  The default settings were not up to snuff so I had to tinker around a bit to get the visual effect I prefer.  I think I am almost there. Part of the problem, I think, is me as this is my very first HDTV and it will take me a while to figure out better settings. Also at the very beginning the picture was utterly wretched but I discovered this was because of a loose AV composite cable - once I shifted to an HDMI cable, the problems went away and, with few exceptions the picture is brilliant.  The only real complaint I have is that in very dark scenes which are almost black there are slight white plumes which come up and down from the four corners of the tv - however, this does not seem to effect the overall picture once it gets going.  My other complaint is that it does not seem to have audio out lines for direct connection to an audio receiver.However, whatever dissatisfaction or complaints I may have with the set (which at this point in time are very few) are tempered by the fact I got the TV for $300.00 here on amazon.  My old cathode ray analog tv, which I bought nearly ten years ago, cost me $695.  I think for $300 this TV can not be beat.  I would happyily buy another TCL set.  I do not have much to compare it with but for the money, this is a very good HDTV.  I am only sorry I did not buy the 56' inch one and that TCL does not seem to make a 3D set.  I would heartily recommend this HDTV to anyone
