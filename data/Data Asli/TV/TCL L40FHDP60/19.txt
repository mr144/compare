I use this tv as a 32 inch high definition monitor.  Its works great. I took some adjusting to get the fonts and colors just right, for 200 bucks I can not beat it.  I have an HDMI output on my computer which is in a cabinet 20 ft away.  That 1 HDMI (Puchased from Amozon) cabel carries video and sound, I have my speakers (Harmon Kardon) plugged into the monitor, the sound is amazing.  I have a high end sound card.  Watching DVDs, streaming video, streaming music or listing my music libray is Awsome!  I have not noticed any pixilation lagging or sound quality issues.I did change the system font to Tahoma, and increased the font size, and adusted the color, took about an hour to get the setting the way I wanted.
