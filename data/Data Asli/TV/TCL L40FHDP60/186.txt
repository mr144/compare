Just got yhe TV yesterday and was amazed at the feel and quality look of the unit.  Base is actually made of thick glass and very heavy.  Setup was a breeze and the picture is every bit as good as my 46 inch Samsung!  It is a bedroom TV for me and I only hook up one hdmi cable for my Dish satelite, so would not know how it works for gaming, etc.  Paid 299 at Amazon and so far, I am thrilled!  Plan to buy a smaller TCL for my kitchen.
