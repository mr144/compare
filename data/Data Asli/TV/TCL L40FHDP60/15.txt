I would definitely recommends this to friends and family. Great 2yr warranty. You do not see to many TVs with 2yr warranty. TV works and functions great. Remote control is user friendly. And for the price you cant beat it. I heard about this company on one of the episodes of GEEKTIME on Siriusxm. Great recommendation
