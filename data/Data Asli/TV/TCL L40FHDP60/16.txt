Got this TV for $320. It's a great TV with a great price tag. The only things that bug me is that it does not have wifi (which is OK for the price) and if you are on a black screen, you can see white edges, it is not 100% black. Also, it takes like 10 seconds to turn on. No big deal though. GREAT picture quality
